RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,855
{\an8}EPISODE 2

3
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,208
{\an8}That can't be. Rounds are at 7:00 a.m.

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,589
{\an8}Right. If the professor wants
to do them now, then we should.

5
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,341
{\an8}Yes, I'll head down right away.

6
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,450
{\an8}Hello?

7
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,160
{\an8}An emergency?

8
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,163
{\an8}Then we'll need Anesthesiology, Surgery,
Internal Medicine, Pediatrics…

9
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,498
And what else?

10
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,626
{\an8}Right, I'll have our professor
and NICU prepared too.

11
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,087
Don't they know
how to throw away expired food?

12
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,389
Hello, Doctor.

13
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,808
I see.

14
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,811
The intern can't do it?

15
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,857
Can I just quickly eat first and…

16
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,860
Okay, I'm coming now.

17
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,174
Long time no see. Did you have dinner yet?

18
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,926
Of course not.

19
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,264
It's only Wednesday,
but why do I feel so tired already?

20
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,599
Because it's Thursday.

21
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,600
No, it's Friday.

22
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,767
You're kidding.

23
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,979
Still, we're getting off
early today. Right?

24
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,898
It's only 10:00 p.m. Isn't that a miracle?

25
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,899
Miracle…

26
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,485
my foot.

27
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,708
Fine.

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,335
I'll go first.

29
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,675
Hello. It's first-year resident Kim Sa-bi.

30
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,010
I'll begin the report.

31
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,764
Prof. Seo's third C-section patient today

32
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,515
{\an8}had firm uterine contractions,

33
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,726
{\an8}and her OP wound
looked good upon checking.

34
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,654
{\an8}Prof. Kong's patient
is a primi at 32 weeks and zero days.

35
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,740
{\an8}She's been receiving inpatient treatment
for preterm labor in MFICU

36
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,658
{\an8}for five days now.

37
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,825
{\an8}The ritodrine dose…

38
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,995
As for the ritodrine…

39
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,081
Thirty!

40
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,125
Right. She's still on 30 cc.

41
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,546
What? No, I knew that. I just said 30--

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,843
Don't tell me… Again?

43
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,349
Let's start over from the beginning.

44
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,279
She's had inpatient treatment
for preterm labor at MFICU

45
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,488
for five days now.

46
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,907
The ritodrine dose is at 30 cc.

47
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,623
This is Pyo Nam-kyung.
My report is for GYN.

48
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,958
Thank you and goodbye.

49
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,336
{\an8}Sorry? Why would you need to hear it?

50
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,714
I see.

51
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,674
Just a moment.

52
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,636
{\an8}In Room 1013,
a 74-year-old ovarian cancer patient.

53
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,638
{\an8}POD is two since the debulking.

54
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,098
{\an8}Sorry?

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,646
{\an8}I haven't checked the cardiac markers yet…

56
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,483
I apologize.

57
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,861
Enough with the apologies, okay?

58
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,237
Start over from the beginning.

59
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,534
Hello, Chief.

60
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,078
Hey, Dr. Myeong.

61
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,040
I heard you did a debulking
for an ovarian cancer patient.

62
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,791
And the surgery took a while.

63
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,960
- I'm glad it went well though.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,338
- Here.
- What's that?

65
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,256
- Tea.
- You can put it here.

66
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,345
But how does an OB fellow
know about GYN surgeries too?

67
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,349
When you look after each of your juniors,
you end up learning everything.

68
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,352
I see. That's impressive.

69
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,730
Your OB schedule alone
would be hectic enough.

70
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,190
It's just my duty.

71
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,149
FIRST-YEAR KIM SA-BI

72
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,317
Chief.

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,070
When you go to that wine bar
with the professors next time,

74
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,654
couldn't you invite me too?

75
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,281
I've been wanting to check it out too.

76
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,284
- You like to drink, Dr. Myeong?
- I do.

77
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,288
<i>There are five stages of grief</i>
<i>that humans go through.</i>

78
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,123
<i>You've all heard of them, right?</i>

79
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,627
<i>First, denial.</i>

80
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,921
She just called me Dae-il earlier.

81
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,424
I told her numerous times

82
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,343
that my name was Um Jae-il.

83
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,386
Am I really that forgettable?

84
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,596
That can't be.

85
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,557
I'm the first-ever
K-pop idol-turned-resident, after all.

86
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,185
She probably just has trouble with names.
Right, Sa-bi?

87
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,856
<i>The second stage is anger.</i>

88
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,529
By the way, they're your own patients.
How do you not know them?

89
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,578
I'm not trying to blame you.

90
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,957
It's just that my plans
keep getting disrupted,

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,667
and it's frustrating for me too.

92
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,922
<i>The third stage is</i>

93
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,049
<i>bargaining.</i>

94
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,265
Delicious.

95
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,017
<i>The fourth stage is…</i>

96
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,229
<i>Depression.</i>

97
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,359
While someone's getting married
to a Kib & Chang lawyer

98
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,527
at Chilla Hotel next month…

99
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,529
Me?

100
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,198
I'm sure I'll be changing
dressings as always.

101
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,245
Hold on. What kind of purse is that?

102
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,039
It's so pretty.

103
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,417
<i>And finally, the fifth stage.</i>

104
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,007
It's Dr. Ki Eun-mi.

105
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,926
- Could it be?
- Is she telling us to go home?

106
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,387
She said we got
four more labor inductions tomorrow.

107
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,307
Then, that's seven in total.

108
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,353
We had five today.

109
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,231
Then, seven tomorrow.

110
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,233
Lucky seven.

111
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,120
<i>The last stage is acceptance.</i>

112
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,206
<i>You eventually accept it.</i>

113
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,592
We'll begin
the first-year resident report.

114
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,265
- That's from <i>On Death and Dying,</i> right?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,727
But those stages perfectly apply
to something else as well.

116
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,978
What's that?

117
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,231
The residents' escape and escaping.

118
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,985
Come on, already?
It's only been three weeks.

119
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,239
That's exactly the problem.
Three weeks is a very tricky period.

120
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,533
It's not long enough
to feel like a waste if you quit,

121
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,411
and you haven't bonded
with your peers enough to stay.

122
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,664
But most importantly, they haven't yet--

123
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,043
They haven't tasted
their first paycheck yet.

124
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,337
As sharp as ever, Do-won.

125
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,551
The warning signs have been showing
for a while, so hold onto them tight.

126
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,511
We've put in a lot of effort
to bring them in.

127
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,595
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

128
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,807
You know, Professor.
It seems like you know everything.

129
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,225
There's one thing I don't know.

130
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,437
It continues to boggle my mind.

131
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,731
Why don't they want to do it?

132
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,775
Do what?

133
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,860
Obstetrics.

134
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,447
Why don't they want to do
something so wonderful?

135
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,329
I'll get going first.

136
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,543
Good night, Professor.

137
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,560
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

138
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,194
Is that your dad's jacket?

139
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,408
What's that? A coin purse?

140
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,286
Hey, if you don't know, just keep quiet.

141
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,829
I had to get on a waitlist for this.

142
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,164
Is that so?

143
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,248
Hi!

144
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,793
Where are you going?

145
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,003
To study!

146
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,552
{\an8}This is a case of dystocia,

147
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,553
{\an8}type one.

148
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,680
{\an8}There's not enough power.

149
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,682
{\an8}To fully understand dystocia,

150
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,976
{\an8}we need to establish the same criteria

151
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,479
{\an8}for whether it's active labor or not.

152
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,065
For that to happen,

153
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,069
we need consistent measurements
regardless of who checks.

154
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,863
Now, let's go back to the basics.

155
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,949
Can someone give me
a simple definition of dystocia?

156
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,702
Difficult and abnormal labor process.

157
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,329
Yes. Spot on.

158
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,623
During childbirth and labor,

159
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,334
there are three factors
that can affect abnormal contractions.

160
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,136
Oxytocin.

161
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,306
It's when oxytocin is used, but…

162
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,432
But?

163
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,688
Oxytocin is used, but…

164
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,026
Despite using it…

165
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,487
Oh Yi-young, you came this unprepared?

166
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,200
Pyo Nam-kyung, give me your answer.

168
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,079
Despite the use of oxytocin,

169
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,581
it's when the baby doesn't descend
for more than two hours.

170
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,292
And…

171
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,752
{\an8}Contraction.

172
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,380
{\an8}Comp…

173
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,464
Contraction.

174
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,425
Compre…

175
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,677
Sa-bi said "contraction," okay?

176
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,096
Jae-il.

177
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,431
- Yes?
- Did you hear that?

178
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,182
Yes, I did.

179
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,311
Are Sa-bi and I
the only ones learning here?

180
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,689
This is like private tutoring then,
not a study group.

181
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,941
"Private tutoring"?

182
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,278
Professor, it's almost time for rounds.

183
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,320
I'll be there.

184
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,740
Let's have Da-hye and Nam-kyung
prepare the next session.

185
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,867
- Okay.
- Okay.

186
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,826
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,996
Do-won went to a conference
with Prof. Im Dong-ju, right?

188
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,415
- Is he returning tomorrow?
- No, the day after.

189
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,332
I see.

190
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,295
You're not going to make rounds, Yi-young?

191
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,547
Right!

192
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,432
Dr. Oh.

193
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,061
If we have seven C-sections in a day,

194
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,606
that means we'll have
seven post-op day two patients, right?

195
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,607
Yes, that's right.

196
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,443
Then, when you present them,
mention their characteristics

197
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,653
so I can better remember who's who.

198
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,363
Right. I'm sorry.

199
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,408
{\an8}And for Ms. Yoon Seon-mi, it's normal
to not have reactivity at 22 weeks.

200
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,452
{\an8}- So no need for an NST.
- Yes, ma'am.

201
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,996
And check on transferring
Ms. Sim Hui-yeong.

202
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,164
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,556
Hello, this is Jongno Yulje.

204
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,975
{\an8}We have a 34-week primigravida
whose baby is small,

205
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,810
{\an8}so we've been monitoring her.

206
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,814
Her amniotic fluid has decreased
and things don't look good.

207
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,901
{\an8}I think we need to deliver the baby,
but we don't have any NICU beds.

208
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,153
{\an8}What? One moment, please.

209
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,989
{\an8}The baby is 1.5 kg,

210
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,283
{\an8}and the AFI is…

211
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,745
Four.

212
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,331
Sorry? The paperwork?

213
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,584
Yes, I'll have it ready.

214
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,212
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

215
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,466
- Dr. Oh.
- Yes?

216
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,219
Why do you do your job like such a fool?

217
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,136
Sorry?

218
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,682
I mean, you stutter
and speak so strangely.

219
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,476
Strangely?

220
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,145
Yi-young, have you arranged
Ms. Sim's transfer?

221
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,188
Yes, I'm working on it.

222
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,066
Include her early prenatal test results
when you prepare the request.

223
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,150
That'll save you time.

224
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,777
Okay. Thank you.

225
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,820
Exactly.

226
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,614
That's exactly what I meant.

227
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,494
Dr. Oh, when you're working,
don't just make calls right away.

228
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,412
First,

229
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,747
use your head.

230
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,000
Is your heart not in it?

231
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,210
You don't have an ounce of passion in you.

232
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,800
What is she talking about?

233
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,679
- Hello!
- Hello.

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,935
Hello, let me help you.

235
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,771
Thank you.

236
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,189
Okay. This way, please.

237
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,900
Obstetrics is this way.

238
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,403
I'm not pregnant.

239
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,071
I'm fine.

240
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,948
Ms. Yeom Mi-so.

241
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,617
Hello.

242
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,912
You should've just stayed in the ER.
I heard you're feeling weak.

243
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,829
Here you go.

244
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,040
- Careful.
- Gosh.

245
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,170
The professor wants to drain
the fluid in your abdomen first.

246
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,172
Chemotherapy will be scheduled after that.

247
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,798
All right.

248
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,551
You don't look very well today.

249
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,181
How can I when I'm at a hospital?

250
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,308
But…

251
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,936
I'm especially irritable today.

252
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,437
Let's go.

253
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,856
Sure.

254
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,034
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>you're cut out to be a doctor.</i>

255
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,703
When I said I felt feverish,

256
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,915
you just said I was fine
and left without even looking at me.

257
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,585
Each time I checked your temperature,
it was always at 37.5°C with no fever.

258
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,546
{\an8}Progesterone levels rise during pregnancy,

259
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,548
{\an8}so it can feel like you have a fever.

260
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,218
Also, I think

261
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,471
you might be someone
who's naturally prone to feeling hot.

262
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,933
What? What did you say?

263
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,769
This is unbelievable.

264
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,563
Are you serious right now?

265
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,358
I'm not prone to feeling hot.

266
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,070
And I'm not dumb enough to confuse
feeling hot with having a fever.

267
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,322
And what about the dressings?

268
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,824
I've been here the past four weeks,

269
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,201
and this was the first time
the dressings hurt.

270
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,662
You came in without a word
and just jabbed me with a needle.

271
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,957
You know what she said
when I said it hurt?

272
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,958
"Feeling pain

273
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,836
can't be helped."

274
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,005
See? Doctor, did you hear that?

275
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,881
That's exactly what she said.

276
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,008
I see.

277
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,301
I was in pain,
and she said it can't be helped.

278
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,762
How could a doctor
say that to her patient?

279
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,141
Mom, do you still think
I'm being too sensitive?

280
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,727
How can I let someone
so apathetic deliver my baby?

281
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,605
Professor, this has never happened before.

282
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,065
You know that, right?

283
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,943
I apologize.
You must've been very frustrated.

284
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,195
I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.

285
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,698
Professor.

286
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,034
Someone like her

287
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,078
shouldn't be a doctor.

288
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,166
Right.

289
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,251
I can't believe this happened. Goodness.

290
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,046
Get some rest.

291
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,638
I'm not asking for a lot.

292
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,724
I didn't tell you
to do surgery or deliver a baby.

293
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,143
I said just do what you're told
without causing trouble.

294
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,269
Was that so difficult?

295
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,940
Go apologize. Tell her you were wrong.

296
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,570
In terms of medical facts,

297
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,156
I don't think I made
any errors or did anything wrong.

298
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,075
Then what did the patient do wrong?

299
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,703
What did she do so wrong
that she can't eat or sleep?

300
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,083
I'm not asking you to apologize
for making a mistake.

301
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,918
It's an apology to console.

302
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,295
An apology filled
with thoughtfulness and empathy.

303
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,297
You know, something like that.

304
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,509
Then, instead of apologizing,

305
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,678
I'll explain the situation to her
in more detail once again--

306
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,515
Just go and apologize to her!
Why are you so dense?

307
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,184
She wants to go to another hospital!

308
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,269
If a patient transfers like that,

309
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,939
who do you think people will blame?
You or me?

310
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,818
{\an8}I'll have a talk with her.

311
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,070
{\an8}I'll resolve this.

312
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,240
Good. Whatever it is, do it.

313
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,075
Do whatever it takes to fix this.

314
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:38,992
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,998
Dr. Kim. Your MBTI type
doesn't have an F, does it?

316
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,708
Sorry?

317
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,669
I don't think you're an F.

318
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,547
I got straight As.

319
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,716
You're a T.

320
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,052
Definitely a T.

321
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,307
Have you eaten?

322
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,017
How are you feeling?

323
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,522
Your numbers have improved a lot.

324
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,857
I see.

325
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,817
And you've started exercising, right?

326
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,902
No, not yet.

327
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,279
As I mentioned yesterday,

328
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,324
you need to exercise often
for your condition to improve.

329
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,993
Try to walk frequently.

330
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,537
But I'm so hungry

331
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,414
that I can't move around.

332
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,498
Have you not eaten

333
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,208
breakfast today…

334
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,879
{\an8}You should've gotten your breakfast.

335
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,345
We didn't give you your food yet, did we?

336
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,263
I'm so sorry.

337
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,265
I'll arrange for your meal right away.

338
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,060
I'm sorry we made you fast
a bit longer than you needed to.

339
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,604
This shouldn't have happened.

340
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,731
I'm truly sorry.

341
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,316
Give her some water first.

342
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,193
- Yes, sir.
- Have some water first.

343
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,711
{\an8}YEOM
ATTENDING DOCTOR: UM JAE-IL

344
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,421
{\an8}YEOM
ATTENDING DOCTOR: PYO NAM-KYUNG

345
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,764
I'm sorry you have to
suffer because of me.

346
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,265
I would've been upset too.

347
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,977
Why did you have to be a busybody
and get on a patient's bad side?

348
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,481
{\an8}You're an enemy, not a colleague.

349
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,109
My horoscope said I'd encounter
an unexpected adversary today.

350
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,194
That was you.

351
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,364
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,116
But, Nam-kyung,

353
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,912
{\an8}I think I could work in the ward
without Dr. Cha knowing.

354
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,914
{\an8}- I can't sit here and do nothing.
- Don't.

355
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,916
{\an8}If you get caught, I'll be dead too.

356
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,293
{\an8}Just stay at the operating room.

357
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,630
{\an8}You're only arranging surgeries.
Surely you can't mess that up.

358
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,259
Nam-kyung, have you eaten yet?

359
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,511
- You haven't eaten either, right?
- No.

360
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,013
I left lunch boxes in the on-call room.
You want them now?

361
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,973
- Okay--
- Later.

362
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,308
Eat first. You must be hungry.

363
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,435
Okay.

364
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,145
Make sure you eat.

365
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,649
I was about to get coffee.
Want some? What do you want?

366
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,109
- Iced Americano--
- Maybe later.

367
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,069
I don't have time right now.

368
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:19,987
Okay.

369
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,618
Eun-mi the Saint, as always.

370
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,036
Nam-kyung, you're lucky--

371
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,955
Of course I want to eat too. I do.

372
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,164
But I don't have the time.

373
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,209
I have to prepare for tomorrow's rounds
and do the dressings too.

374
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,087
Prof. Ryu has nine surgeries tomorrow,

375
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,673
{\an8}and they're sending
another patient from the ICU.

376
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,509
Dressings alone take all day,
but they're adding another patient.

377
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,929
And that patient
you caused trouble with, Yeom Mi-so…

378
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,223
- She's apparently a nightmare.
- How so?

379
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,643
She complained about a four-person room,
so they moved her to a private one.

380
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,979
Then she wanted the room next door
with a bigger window.

381
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,899
{\an8}- And she wants dressings changed--
- Excuse me.

382
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,114
You've only changed
my dressing twice today.

383
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,992
I see. Ms. Yeom Mi-so, right?

384
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,577
Yes.

385
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,079
I just received the transfer now.

386
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,624
I want them changed
four times a day, okay?

387
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,293
I see. Sure.

388
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,879
And please pay
special attention to being sanitary.

389
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,380
Okay?

390
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:21,798
Sure.

391
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,145
Want me to bring you your lunch box?

392
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,396
I said I don't have time.

393
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,315
Right.

394
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,043
Are you listening to music?

395
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,754
Then what are you listening to?

396
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,423
What are you listening to?

397
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,551
Okay. I'm sorry.

398
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:09,846
Goodbye.

399
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,519
{\an8}- What were you listening to?
- Insults.

400
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,064
{\an8}I guess she really hates me.

401
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,357
{\an8}Dr. Myeong Eun-won?

402
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,444
The nurses told me

403
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,489
she's notorious
for being hard on first-years.

404
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,827
How childish. She should join the army
if she's that into disciplining people.

405
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,288
And apparently,
she's even more sensitive this year.

406
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,124
Why?

407
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,212
{\an8}Prof. Im Dong-ju is retiring next year.

408
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,340
{\an8}She transferred here
in hopes of taking that open spot.

409
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,135
The junior residents hate her,

410
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,887
but she seems to have
a good reputation among the professors.

411
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,558
They say her chances
of becoming a professor are high.

412
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,605
Our second year will be hard too
if she really does become a professor.

413
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,360
Good luck.

414
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,737
Hey, we're in the same boat.

415
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,616
Play some music.

416
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,743
There's a nice group called HI-BOYZ.

417
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,661
No, thanks.

418
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,996
Why not?

419
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,127
<i>Run with me</i>

420
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:28,466
<i>It feels like we need to go somewhere</i>

421
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:35,974
<i>You look like you're about to cry</i>

422
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,228
{\an8}MYEONG EUN-WON

423
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,523
Hello, Dr. Myeong.

424
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,525
What?

425
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,781
Doctor, I'm really sorry.

426
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,658
{\an8}Our patient has a history of myomectomy.

427
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,244
{\an8}She went into active labor
with contractions every two minutes.

428
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,829
{\an8}We need to do an emergency C-section.

429
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,414
<i>What? Right now?</i>

430
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,458
<i>There aren't any ORs available.</i>

431
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,460
<i>Not a single one.</i>

432
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,669
But we need one.

433
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,962
Please open a room for us.

434
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,423
If there's a room
that's just been used, I'll go clean it.

435
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,508
Please, just this once.

436
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,097
They'll be rushing down here
any minute now.

437
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,559
Your department is like the Grim Reaper.

438
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,478
I get chills whenever you guys call.

439
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,854
I'm sorry.

440
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,898
Her contractions
suddenly came every two minutes.

441
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,399
I have a child too.

442
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,068
I get where you're coming from,

443
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,570
but I wasn't lying
about not having any rooms available.

444
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,739
We were lucky this surgery ended early.

445
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,366
Thank you.

446
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,336
Dr. Myeong, I'll go
and escort the patient here.

447
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,754
<i>No, I'll do it.</i>

448
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,590
<i>Stay there and hold onto the room. Okay?</i>

449
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,051
Yes, ma'am.

450
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,265
CURRENT TIME

451
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,434
What's taking so long?

452
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,229
We put the next surgery on hold
because you said it was urgent.

453
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,689
I'll call her again.

454
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,129
It's not easy to time the delivery
if the surgery is decided suddenly.

455
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,923
Not only picking a surgery time
but also picking one at night

456
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,842
is almost impossible in Obstetrics.

457
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,387
If your daughter becomes president,
I get some credit too, right?

458
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,557
Goodness. Of course.

459
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,392
- The patient's contractions--
- Good work.

460
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,021
Professors don't usually
accommodate timing like this.

461
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,564
You're right.

462
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,191
I won't forget this kindness.

463
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,361
If you send your friends my way,
I'll take good care of them.

464
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,114
Okay. Thank you.

465
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,409
Dr. Joo, I appreciate your help today.

466
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,710
Dr. Myeong.

467
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,463
I heard this surgery was extremely urgent.

468
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,424
What? I'm not sure what you mean.

469
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,968
Did something happen?

470
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,511
You called me earlier and--

471
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,512
I did?

472
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,098
Right, we did talk on the phone.
What about it?

473
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,313
{\an8}Sir, please give her
an epidural for the PCA.

474
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,823
Anesthesia with an epidural catheter
will take 30 minutes to work.

475
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,994
Look, Dr. First-Year. This isn't right.

476
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,039
You can't lie to other departments
to get what you want.

477
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,957
- That's not the case--
- Forget it.

478
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,002
What am I going to tell my professor?

479
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,546
This is so annoying. Damn it.

480
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,032
It's her first meal in days.

481
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,618
I shouldn't disturb her.

482
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,829
She said to be considerate.

483
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,455
Right.

484
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,165
Be considerate.

485
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,055
It's already 10:00 p.m.

486
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,267
Not sleeping is harmful for the baby.

487
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,395
This is empathy.

488
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,731
Empathy for the pregnant mother.

489
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,441
Yeah.

490
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,202
I wanted to shower today.

491
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,621
Forget it.

492
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,414
I can't do this anymore. Damn it.

493
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,168
{\an8}YEOM
ATTENDING DOCTOR: PYO NAM-KYUNG

494
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,931
Ms. Yeom, are you feeling any better?

495
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,390
I'll change your dressing.

496
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,229
Did you wash your hands?

497
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,688
Yes, I did.

498
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,818
Wait.

499
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,319
Yes?

500
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,532
Can you wear new gloves?

501
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,158
I just put these on.

502
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,244
I'd like you to use new forceps too.

503
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,122
Sure.

504
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,052
I need this twice in the morning
and afternoon each. Four times total.

505
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,387
You know that, right?

506
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,431
I've been informed.

507
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,600
{\an8}Please stick to that schedule.

508
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,311
{\an8}I'm asking you for this favor.

509
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,772
Okay.

510
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,443
I'll remove the tape.

511
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,530
This might sting.

512
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,616
{\an8}Um Jae-il…

513
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,415
Doctor, Ms. Park Ga-yeong has disappeared.

514
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,542
- She's scheduled for surgery today.
- Right, her.

515
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,545
{\an8}She had severe pain from a ruptured cyst,
so we operated immediately.

516
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,964
Did I not tell you?
She's in the ICU right now.

517
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,674
Then, I'll go there--

518
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:28,011
That's not necessary. You should rest.
I'll call you if anything comes up.

519
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,726
Ms. Park liked me.

520
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,229
She asked me to be there for her surgery.

521
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,023
Excuse me. Doctor.

522
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,108
It's about Ms. Kim.

523
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,445
What do we do?

524
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,072
- Surgery's tomorrow.
- Ms. Shin is in a lot of pain.

525
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,532
No, I'll ask the professor…

526
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,450
Excuse me.

527
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:54,203
Ms. Park would like some consultation
on myomectomy tomorrow.

528
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,955
I think you should see her.

529
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,918
Ms. Oh's vitals are unsteady.
I think you need to take a look.

530
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,755
Where's Dr. Kim Sa-bi?

531
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,006
Where is she?

532
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,721
You have a conference.
Don't be late for it.

533
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,852
I clearly told you yesterday, didn't I?

534
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,938
I told you to go talk to her.

535
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,733
I did go, but she was eating.

536
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,779
I went again at night,

537
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,740
but she needs to sleep well.

538
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,326
So out of empathy and consideration--

539
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,410
Hey!

540
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,290
The patient was right.

541
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,085
Dr. Kim, how will you manage as a doctor?

542
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,588
You can't empathize
or get the timing right.

543
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,924
And you can't even pick up signs
your patient's sending.

544
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,678
That's why such a simple issue
has blown up like this!

545
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,182
No more excuses.

546
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,809
Just fix it somehow.

547
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,686
Fix it no matter what, got that?

548
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,063
Do it right now. Understood?

549
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,065
I won't stand this any longer.

550
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,066
This is

551
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,694
your last warning, okay?

552
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,413
{\an8}What am I going to do?

553
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,925
All right, is it general anesthesia today?

554
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,301
Yes, it is.

555
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,721
Sang-hyeon, double-check everything.

556
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,348
Has the patient been fasting?

557
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,975
Yes, she's been fasting.

558
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,812
Sang-hyeon, did you check?

559
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,772
Did you ask the patient directly?

560
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,400
Yes, I did.

561
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,069
{\an8}And operability?

562
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,404
{\an8}PREOPERATIVE TESTS

563
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,159
I'll check.

564
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,580
Eun-won, has the operability
all been checked?

565
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,544
{\an8}I thought this surgery had no indications,
so Pediatrics wasn't needed?

566
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,588
Dr. Myeong said you were needed.

567
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,672
I see.

568
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:15,011
Is the baby really in distress though?
Can I take your word for it?

569
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:16,846
Sorry?

570
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,432
You always say they are,
but they're fine when they come out.

571
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,517
I was suspicious of a few past cases.

572
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,644
I'm not sure
which cases you're referring to.

573
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,355
There were several.
Rather than say which specific ones…

574
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,733
I wonder if you're only calling us

575
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,735
so we take the blame
if something goes wrong.

576
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,361
What did you say?

577
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,865
You know Pediatrics
is severely understaffed.

578
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,118
I'm just saying
let's not lie to each other from now on.

579
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,204
That's what I'm saying.

580
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,461
- Hi.
- Hello.

581
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,798
Oh, no. You're missing lunch
because of us again.

582
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,840
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,385
Hey, first-year. Don't mess up today.

584
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,096
Everyone's working so hard.

585
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,614
Dr. Pyo.

586
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,284
Ms. Yu Jeong-hye in Room 1013
is post-op day two with a slight fever.

587
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,328
Has this antipyretic prescription
been confirmed?

588
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,871
Yes.

589
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,791
As for Ms. Kim Seon-a in Room 1016,

590
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,460
{\an8}the professor said
her WBC count was too high

591
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,712
{\an8}and asked for ESR and CRP tests.

592
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,048
After I do my charting first.

593
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,591
I have 20 charts backed up.

594
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,135
Okay.

595
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,266
Hello, Dr. Ki.

596
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,810
<i>Hey, Nam-kyung.</i>
<i>We're at the cafeteria now--</i>

597
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,853
I'm okay.

598
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,771
I have a backlog of work.

599
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,857
Could I take a rain check?

600
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,025
Okay, bye.

601
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:57,989
And…

602
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,535
It's time to change Ms. Yeom's dressing.

603
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,414
I think she'll make
a scene again if we're late.

604
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,749
She's so fussy for no reason!

605
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,878
Why does she want me to change
her dressing if my hands are that filthy?

606
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,881
It's not like a good dressing
will make her illness go away,

607
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,883
so why is she so obsessed with it?

608
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,093
Gosh, I hate her so much.

609
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,846
Mi-so? More like Mi-sad.
She always looks miserable…

610
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,819
Nurse Ju-yeon.

611
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,196
Yes?

612
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,156
Could you call the intern, please?

613
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,824
The intern?

614
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,330
I don't think I can change
Ms. Yeom's dressings anymore.

615
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,961
Geez, that's too harsh.

616
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,463
Right?

617
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,757
She shouldn't treat
a first-year like that.

618
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,674
I agree.

619
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,305
That's the fifth ambulance today.

620
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,059
{\an8}Gosh, I bet the ER
is going to be short-staffed.

621
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,477
{\an8}Yes, I'm coming right now.

622
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,564
Yeah, Dr. Um.
Pediatrics is severely understaffed.

623
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,483
- Be there in 30 seconds.
- Goodbye.

624
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,076
Hello, Dr. Cha.

625
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,536
I requested the urgent CT readings
you asked for

626
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,581
{\an8}and called surgery to tell them
OR 11 has been car-inned.

627
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,999
{\an8}Should I go straight to the OR?

628
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,002
<i>That's okay.</i>
<i>I can finish up with the intern.</i>

629
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,255
I see.

630
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,384
Then, you don't need me?

631
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,135
<i>- No, it's okay.</i>
<i>- Dr. Cha!</i>

632
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,553
<i>Coming!</i>

633
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,806
<i>You can go home for today. Good work.</i>

634
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,026
This is the first time in my life
I've ever been scolded.

635
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,154
Is this what you call
being "in the doghouse"?

636
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,781
I've fallen out of favor,

637
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,741
haven't I?

638
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,535
I think so.

639
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,998
I really like Professor Seo.

640
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,917
That's why I chose OB.

641
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,587
She must be so disappointed in me now.

642
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,924
What should I do?

643
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,260
Well, I don't know.

644
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,972
People get disappointed in me
all the time,

645
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,433
so it wouldn't really bother me.

646
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,601
But I don't know about you.

647
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,104
The patient said…

648
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,734
someone like me shouldn't be a doctor.

649
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,694
She speaks too harshly.

650
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,404
Like me.

651
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,406
Yi-young.

652
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,577
Do you really think someone like me
shouldn't be a doctor?

653
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,455
I'm not qualified, am I?

654
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,002
Are you quitting?

655
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,380
You're quitting as a doctor?

656
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,134
When?

657
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,057
I'm going to bear it
one more time and then quit.

658
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,686
No, I'll keep going.

659
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,856
I want to be a doctor.

660
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,568
Then do it.

661
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,320
If you want to, then do it.

662
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,322
Should I?

663
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,157
I'll keep going then, okay?

664
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,202
Yeah, sure.

665
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,914
I'll see the patient
one more time before I go. Bye.

666
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,969
She's a bit of a lunatic too.

667
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,854
MYEONG EUN-WON

668
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,401
I'm heading into surgery now.

669
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,861
Can you get consent forms
from tomorrow's surgical patients?

670
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,863
Again?

671
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,407
<i>What? What did you say?</i>

672
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,950
<i>Hello?</i>

673
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,702
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

674
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,289
<i>Also, you didn't send one this morning.</i>

675
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,207
Sorry?

676
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,375
Your photo.

677
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,962
What? Are you giving up already?
After just a few days?

678
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,770
I just sent it. I forgot.

679
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,023
Is that really the truth?

680
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,733
Lying is a habit too.

681
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,820
<i>You need to develop</i>
<i>good habits from the start.</i>

682
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,824
<i>And you can't do whatever you want here.</i>

683
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,784
<i>This isn't your home.</i>

684
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,328
<i>That's not how things are done</i>
<i>at the workplace.</i>

685
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,541
<i>I'm saying all of this</i>
<i>for your own good, so…</i>

686
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,547
Look at you.

687
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,883
You have a temper, don't you?

688
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,552
What?

689
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,597
"I'll do the suturing later"?

690
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,850
You've lost your mind. How dare you?

691
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,529
I may be broke, but I still have my pride.

692
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,073
I quit. I didn't want to do it anyway.

693
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,701
<i>OB-GYN, code blue.</i>

694
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,954
<i>Main building, basement level 1.</i>
<i>OB-GYN, code blue.</i>

695
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,665
- Is it a chemo patient?
<i>- Main building, basement level…</i>

696
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,583
Could it be…

697
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,294
A pregnant woman needs CPR?

698
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,631
But everyone on call is in surgery.

699
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,382
<i>OB-GYN, code blue.</i>

700
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,843
{\an8}<i>- Main building, basement level 1.</i>
- No one's here.

701
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,972
{\an8}- Damn it.
<i>- Main building, basement level 1…</i>

702
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,850
{\an8}Damn it.

703
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,149
God, why isn't she picking up?

704
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
Excuse me. OB-GYN coming through.

705
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,618
Is she okay?

706
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,037
Let's switch. One, two, three.

707
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,540
Prof. Kong is almost done
with her surgery,

708
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,208
so I booked the OR next to it.

709
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,377
She'll come over right after
to do the C-section.

710
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,337
- We'll move the patient.
- Let's switch.

711
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,005
One, two, three.

712
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,679
- Raise her head a bit.
- Careful.

713
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,559
One, two, three.

714
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,024
- Continue CPR, please.
- Okay.

715
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,197
Excuse me.

716
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,408
What happened?

717
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,369
Good job. Go now.

718
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,162
Me?

719
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,164
There's no one to assist
in that room! Hurry!

720
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,082
Yes, ma'am.

721
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,793
Hello, Professor Seo.

722
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,545
Aren't you on call today?

723
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,005
Yes, I am.

724
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,464
Then, why didn't you pick up?

725
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,508
I was in surgery.

726
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,510
I see. Okay.

727
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,263
But which OR?

728
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,765
I was in surgery too.

729
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,393
Well…

730
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,479
I…

731
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,691
The surgery I was preparing for
was canceled, so I was resting.

732
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:32,693
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,944
What are you sorry for?

734
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,571
For lying?

735
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,908
Or for dawdling when they called
an OB-GYN code blue?

736
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,411
I…

737
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,788
Don't bother answering.

738
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,291
We'll no longer
be seeing each other anyway.

739
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,347
You sure are impressive, Dr. Oh.

740
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,767
A first-year who didn't panic.
I can't believe how calm you were.

741
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,103
The mother and her baby
are alive thanks to you.

742
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,438
Well done. I mean it.

743
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,357
Thank you.

744
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,525
Monitor her vitals carefully
today and tomorrow.

745
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,485
Yes, ma'am.

746
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,402
Tomorrow?

747
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,364
Excuse me.

748
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:19,948
Tomorrow, ma'am?

749
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,909
You want me to do it?

750
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,160
Then who will do it?

751
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,330
I'll do it.

752
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:31,085
You're much better than Dr. Kim Sa-bi.

753
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,087
Come to OB.

754
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,673
- If you join us, I'll--
- That's okay.

755
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,385
What I mean is…

756
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,679
I said that because I'm really okay.

757
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,809
Have a good night.

758
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,605
Geez.

759
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,732
They're all the same.

760
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,152
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

761
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,954
What? You're already here?

762
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,791
Or did you never leave?

763
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,044
No, I couldn't leave.

764
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,671
But today,

765
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,923
I'm definitely leaving.

766
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,633
What's with that backpack?

767
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,677
People might think you're running away.

768
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,473
Look. I--

769
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,976
Later. I haven't prepared
for rounds at all.

770
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,772
I didn't check the X-rays.
I'm so in trouble.

771
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,482
And the dressings.

772
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,651
When am I going to finish all of those?

773
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:38,652
Hey…

774
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,990
I went to talk to her,
but she wouldn't let me in.

775
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,033
She doesn't want to talk.

776
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,413
I really can't do this anymore.

777
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,343
Jae-il, we're not in the mood--

778
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,306
- Hello.
- Hi.

779
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,474
- Hello.
- Hi.

780
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,558
Hello.

781
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,351
- Did you have breakfast?
- No, I'm hungry.

782
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:12,811
But I have to go.

783
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,313
I bought some burgers. Won't you…

784
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,690
- What's going on--
- Thank you.

785
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,637
SPRING GIVEAWAY EVENT

786
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,351
Fine.

787
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,394
I'd just be a nuisance.

788
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,396
I'm neither helpful nor needed.

789
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,774
They're better off without me.

790
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,238
DR. CHA DA-HYE

791
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,658
I didn't run away.
I'm just late. I'm on my way.

792
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,077
<i>What? Dr. Um?</i>

793
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,621
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

794
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,958
Yes, Doctor. Loud and clear.

795
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,751
I didn't run away. I--

796
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,129
<i>Today's surgery is five hours long,</i>
<i>so there's nothing to prepare during then.</i>

797
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,882
<i>There's nothing to do,</i>
<i>so get some sleep in the meantime.</i>

798
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,806
She doesn't know

799
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,974
that I ran away.

800
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,734
Pyo Nam-kyung.

801
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,652
Yes?

802
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,283
How can you seriously have
an appetite right now?

803
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,244
Why do patients keep complaining
about the dressings?

804
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,996
- Well…
- What is it?

805
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,290
I'm sorry.

806
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,792
{\an8}I thought you were at least good at that.
What's going on?

807
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,711
You don't even have that many patients.

808
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,513
Dr. Pyo.

809
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,350
Ms. Yeom from the private room
is asking for you.

810
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,519
- She says it's past time for her dressing.
- Me?

811
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,481
Can't someone else go instead?

812
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,569
She got very upset
when the intern came by yesterday.

813
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,364
She specifically wants you to do it.
What should we do?

814
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,624
Don't press too hard.

815
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,709
Please make it as painless as possible.

816
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,210
Okay.

817
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:53,138
Yesterday, I made a mistake…

818
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,268
I'm sorry.

819
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,771
From now on, another doctor will--

820
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:01,813
No.

821
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,024
I want you to do it.

822
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,610
- Sorry?
- Four times a day. Just like now.

823
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,614
If that's not possible,
I'll speak to the professor.

824
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,990
No, that's okay.

825
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,867
I will do it.

826
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,297
Professor Kong

827
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,549
yells at me

828
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,510
and tells me to get out.

829
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,054
Professor Seo

830
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,473
won't even look at me.

831
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,183
I…

832
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,144
don't think I can be a doctor.

833
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,530
MYEONG EUN-WON

834
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,200
You can't hang up.

835
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,162
I'm fine. You can go.

836
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,290
No, it's okay.
I've done everything she asked anyway.

837
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,127
Besides…

838
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,296
I'm leaving anyway.

839
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,507
You are?

840
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,051
To the ward? The OR?

841
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,181
Somewhere else.

842
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,519
- Hello.
- Hi.

843
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,397
- Hello.
- You're both here.

844
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,481
I was about to call you.

845
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,358
Sa-bi, Eun-mi's waiting in the cafeteria.

846
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,359
Right.

847
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,945
- Goodbye.
- Enjoy your meal.

848
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,198
And Dr. Oh--

849
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,325
Me? Why me?
I've done everything I was asked to do.

850
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,494
Yeah, that's why I have a favor to ask.

851
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,747
Can I see you in front of the ER
in ten minutes?

852
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,171
I let them know at Songdo.

853
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,839
- Am I going alone?
- Yeah.

854
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,843
If the baby suddenly comes out
on the way there,

855
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,430
{\an8}clamp the umbilical cord with clips
and cut it with sterile scissors.

856
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,392
You're the attending doctor and surgeon
until she gets there. Got it?

857
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,776
You didn't bite.

858
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,778
You're quick to catch on.

859
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,071
You wouldn't send a first-year
if it was that dangerous.

860
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,323
Exactly.

861
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,786
I've checked the patient's condition,
so don't be too nervous.

862
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,245
You'll be fine on the trip.

863
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,831
And get some air too while you're away.

864
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,586
See you later.

865
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,131
Hello? I'm coming now.

866
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,892
It's the perfect weather for running away.

867
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,563
- Hello.
- Hello.

868
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,565
Doctor, how long will it take?

869
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,983
I think about an hour.

870
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,611
I see.

871
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,531
If you feel uncomfortable,
let me know right away.

872
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,115
Okay, Doctor.

873
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,961
{\an8}Hello, Doctor.

874
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:11,920
{\an8}<i>Right, you're eating.</i>

875
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,673
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry, but could you come here</i>
<i>in about ten minutes?</i>

876
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,758
{\an8}Sure. I'll go now.

877
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,530
Is that you?

878
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,615
Nam-kyung, is that you?

879
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,826
- What?
- It is!

880
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,119
I didn't know you worked here.

881
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,580
Right. It was Jongno Yulje.

882
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,416
You were in the middle of eating. Eat up.

883
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,626
No, it's fine. I'm done.

884
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,421
Hye-seon, what brings you here?
Why are you at the hospital?

885
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,757
The health checkup center director
is my future father-in-law's friend.

886
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,259
I'm here for a pre-wedding checkup.

887
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,970
Right, you're getting married.

888
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,347
You have to come, okay?

889
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,683
- Sure. I'll be there.
- Good.

890
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,645
Hey, I almost didn't recognize you though.

891
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,314
You look like a different person.

892
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,399
I've been a bit busy.

893
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,777
Hold on.

894
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,240
Hey, it's almost time.

895
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,326
I need to go first. Finish your meal.

896
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,245
What? Okay, bye.

897
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,684
{\an8}Hello?

898
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,269
{\an8}<i>Dr. Pyo, it's Ms. Yeom.</i>

899
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,563
{\an8}<i>She's complaining</i>
<i>that there's more discharge,</i>

900
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,482
{\an8}<i>asking why</i>
<i>she hasn't received painkillers,</i>

901
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,901
{\an8}<i>and she says her heart is beating faster.</i>

902
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,653
{\an8}<i>- You should come and check--</i>
- I can't go.

903
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,404
{\an8}<i>Sorry?</i>

904
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,407
{\an8}She seems bent on making me miserable
for speaking rudely to her,

905
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,825
{\an8}but I'm not going anymore.

906
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,328
{\an8}Someone else can do it,
or she can do it herself.

907
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,163
{\an8}Just tell her to handle it herself.

908
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,672
I can't.

909
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,882
I can't do this anymore.

910
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,593
<i>I've endured it for quite a while</i>

911
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:28,556
<i>I endured it for a long time</i>

912
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,270
<i>While I aged…</i>

913
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,188
Hello.

914
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,273
Hello. Where would you like to go?

915
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,984
Myeongjin Studio Apartments…

916
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,568
No, the bathhouse.

917
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,362
No, wait.

918
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,489
The department store.
Take me to the nearest one.

919
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,491
Sure, okay.

920
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,749
- Sir, could you turn that up?
- Sure.

921
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,589
<i>I'm leaving work</i>

922
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,219
<i>I'm leaving work</i>

923
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:12,100
<i>Now, to find my happiness</i>

924
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:17,564
<i>I'm going far, far away</i>

925
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,191
<i>I'm quitting</i>

926
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,779
<i>I'm going to quit</i>

927
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,823
NURSE JU-YEON

928
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,826
<i>Oh, whatever</i>

929
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:36,082
<i>I'm going to bet on myself</i>

930
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,794
<i>I'm leaving work</i>

931
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,223
Sir, please turn around! Hurry!

932
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,822
I feel like my stomach
is tightening a bit.

933
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,201
That can't be.

934
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,577
Maybe I'm wrong.

935
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,539
But it feels different from when we left.

936
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,707
I should be okay, right?

937
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,087
Where exactly are you feeling discomfort?

938
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,800
The left side feels tight.

939
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,095
{\an8}Just a moment.

940
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,062
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Dr. Ku.

941
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,564
We still have about 30 minutes to go,

942
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,858
but the patient says
her stomach suddenly feels tight.

943
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,029
{\an8}How much pain is she in? Does it feel
like she needs to use the bathroom?

944
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,323
Does it feel like you need to push?

945
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,368
No, I don't think so.

946
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,915
She's neither in severe pain
nor does she feel like using the bathroom.

947
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,333
{\an8}Do you see any amniotic fluid?

948
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,460
{\an8}No, I don't.

949
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,879
{\an8}It's not an urgent situation,

950
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,048
{\an8}so monitor the baby's heart rate
with the Doppler

951
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,300
{\an8}and check manually
if the contractions are okay.

952
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,802
Reassure the patient too.

953
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,387
Okay, I will.

954
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,482
Sir, please hurry.

955
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,785
<i>- The number you called is unavailable…</i>
- Who is she talking to?

956
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,788
<i>After your call goes through…</i>

957
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,875
<i>I'm leaving a text</i>
<i>since you're not answering.</i>

958
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,335
<i>Please clean up the lines in Room 1011.</i>

959
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,713
Room 1011 is Ms. Yeom's room.

960
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,466
Why suddenly clean up her lines?

961
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,183
{\an8}PATIENT NAME
DEPARTMENT

962
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,037
Where did you go?

963
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,457
Dr. Ku cleaned up the lines for you.

964
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,668
Why all of a sudden…

965
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,394
Nurse.

966
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,105
Let me do the dressing just once.

967
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,273
Sorry?

968
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,775
I couldn't do it yesterday,

969
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,528
and I only did it once today.

970
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,572
So let me do it one last time.

971
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,449
Go ahead then.

972
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,159
But did you wash your hands?

973
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,412
Then I'll wash my hands first and…

974
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,208
What are you doing here?

975
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,710
To get my glasses.

976
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,756
How can you be an hour late?

977
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,926
There's discharge,
and my heartbeat seems irregular.

978
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,096
Where were you? I was so worried!

979
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,475
I moved to the room next door,
because the window there was bigger.

980
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,107
Good for you.

981
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,994
{\an8}"Conta" will infect the area.

982
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,455
Something got in my eye.

983
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,625
How do you know that term?

984
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,086
Get treated as much as I do,
and you pick up things.

985
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,423
Don't worry.

986
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,426
I washed my hands twice,
and these gloves are brand-new.

987
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,438
Did you get in trouble because of me?

988
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,108
Or are you having a hard time
because of me?

989
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,776
No.

990
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,572
It's because of me.

991
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,326
I'm sorry if I've been a bother.

992
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,416
I'm sorry for being difficult.

993
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:32,712
That's okay.

994
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,093
The professor said
you were good at dressings.

995
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:45,183
I know applying this medicine
isn't a big deal,

996
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,270
but I thought it might be better
if someone who was skilled did it.

997
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,569
Three years of going through this

998
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,863
changes a person.

999
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,658
I know it's tough for you,

1000
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:03,910
but…

1001
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,539
I end up only thinking about myself.

1002
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,251
I'm sorry.

1003
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,756
No, dressings are important.

1004
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,549
It's nothing trivial.

1005
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,761
Good dressings help wounds heal faster,

1006
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,721
and you can be discharged sooner.

1007
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,556
And I'm really good at it.

1008
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,226
I'm the best among the first-years.

1009
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,063
Does that mean you'll come again tomorrow?

1010
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,025
Yes. Four times.

1011
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,276
Tomorrow morning.

1012
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,197
Just come once in the morning
to remove my nasal tube.

1013
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,991
Are you being discharged?

1014
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,496
See? Your discharge came sooner!

1015
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,126
You must be happy that I'm leaving.

1016
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,919
No, I'm not.

1017
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,671
No. Wait.

1018
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,424
{\an8}You're getting discharged.
That's the best news ever!

1019
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:03,803
{\an8}I'm also really good
at removing nasal tubes.

1020
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,691
{\an8}SONGDO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1021
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,165
Are you okay?

1022
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,356
Dr. Oh Yi-young?

1023
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,316
Yes, that's me!

1024
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,985
Hello.

1025
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,696
You're from Jongno Yulje, right?

1026
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,240
Why haven't you left yet?

1027
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,659
I wanted to know if the patient was okay.

1028
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,915
She kept saying
her stomach felt tight during the trip.

1029
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:17,418
Then she said she was fine.
Then she said to hurry because it hurt.

1030
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,630
But our doctor said she was okay.

1031
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:22,924
Dr. Ku Do-won?

1032
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:23,841
Yes.

1033
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,553
But I'm just a first-year,
and this is all new to me.

1034
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,515
I don't know her that well,
so I was worried.

1035
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,517
I think she was in pain

1036
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,394
because the uterine contraction inhibitor
didn't work properly.

1037
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:36,813
I see.

1038
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,064
She's fine now.

1039
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,398
She's really okay.

1040
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,194
You must've been very scared.

1041
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,946
I was.

1042
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,242
If a fourth-year says it's okay,
then it's really okay.

1043
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:52,912
And if it's not okay,
then it's that doctor's fault.

1044
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,291
That's the one good thing
about being a first-year.

1045
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,460
If things go south,
you can blame your seniors

1046
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,045
or whoever gave the orders.

1047
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,341
You're right. It's all Ku's fault.

1048
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,262
But even if it wasn't my fault,

1049
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,806
if something had happened to the patient,

1050
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,518
I would've never forgiven myself.

1051
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,814
I should get going then.

1052
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:20,731
Okay.

1053
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,527
Hold on, Doctor.

1054
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,448
Care to have some coffee before you go?

1055
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:30,992
Sorry?

1056
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,083
SONGDO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1057
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,838
You must be an excellent first-year,
seeing how they sent you for the transfer.

1058
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,548
Thank you.

1059
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,675
Your seniors must adore you.

1060
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,969
Not at all.

1061
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,722
Come on.
Then those seniors are the problem.

1062
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,268
You see, I barely made it into residency.

1063
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,022
All I remember was being scolded
during the first three months.

1064
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,649
Everyone would yell at me on sight.

1065
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,360
It was my first time,
so how could I possibly know anything?

1066
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,279
I couldn't understand them.
I felt so wronged.

1067
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,993
But today, I finally realized
why I got scolded so much.

1068
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,497
I was just a robot.

1069
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:24,670
I just followed their orders,
whatever they were.

1070
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,842
I wasn't concerned or sincerely interested
in the patients at all.

1071
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:35,222
That's not something you can learn
or be taught, you know?

1072
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,724
So of course I didn't know.

1073
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,940
But you, as a first-year,
already knew that.

1074
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,197
You should go before the traffic gets bad.

1075
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,573
Here you go.

1076
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,994
What's this?

1077
01:05:57,578 --> 01:06:00,414
It's for Dr. Ku.
Make sure he gets it today.

1078
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,208
I see.

1079
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,460
SONGDO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1080
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:07,797
Okay.

1081
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,967
It's important for the patient,
so please hurry. Okay?

1082
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:12,802
Okay?

1083
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:16,764
Okay.

1084
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,015
Thank you.

1085
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,141
Excuse me.

1086
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,355
{\an8}Hi, honey.

1087
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,398
{\an8}Yeah.

1088
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,483
{\an8}<i>Kalguksu?</i>

1089
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,068
{\an8}Sounds great.

1090
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,279
{\an8}Then, order some fresh kimchi for me.

1091
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,865
{\an8}Okay.

1092
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,119
{\an8}All right.

1093
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,787
{\an8}I love you more.

1094
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,038
{\an8}Okay.

1095
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,748
Okay, all right. Bye.

1096
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:49,839
We're newlyweds, you see.

1097
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:50,840
I see.

1098
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,802
Okay, Dr. Oh. Take care.

1099
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,679
Thank you.

1100
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,180
No need to thank me.

1101
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,351
You were terrific today.

1102
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,812
Let's definitely meet again, okay?

1103
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,655
Damn it.

1104
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:37,928
Hello.

1105
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,430
I need to talk to you.

1106
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:40,931
Okay.

1107
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:45,686
I've been watching you.

1108
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,229
Sorry?

1109
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,899
Ms. Cheon Eun-pyo in MFICU.

1110
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,235
Right. I'm sorry.

1111
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,737
There's nothing to be sorry about.

1112
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,157
If you really can't do it, then don't.

1113
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,204
How about you try something else instead?

1114
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,372
What?

1115
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,125
I'll work hard!

1116
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:39,949
Excuse me.

1117
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,663
Dr. Kim.

1118
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,335
Your snoring is keeping me up.

1119
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:53,170
I'm sorry.

1120
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,173
Are you protesting or something?

1121
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,552
I'll accept this as your apology.

1122
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:01,053
You can go.

1123
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,471
Wait. The thing is…

1124
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,932
I wasn't here to apologize.

1125
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,100
It's because I'm worried.

1126
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,435
What?

1127
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,937
Professor Seo said

1128
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,773
I should help with what I'm good at,
not with what I'm bad at.

1129
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,277
So I analyzed your chart.

1130
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,363
Your blood pressure baseline has been
slowly rising since two days ago.

1131
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,866
Your blood pressure
was 150 over 90 this morning,

1132
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,033
and you had a headache.

1133
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,078
In my judgment,

1134
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,623
I think you might be
developing pre-eclampsia.

1135
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,791
What?

1136
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,043
It can lead to seizures or convulsions.

1137
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,171
I mean…

1138
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:38,924
If you're that worried,
do it in the morning.

1139
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,135
You can check then.

1140
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:45,431
You see, your blood test results
will be available soon.

1141
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,559
I was going to leave
after just seeing them.

1142
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,811
I usually don't need much sleep,

1143
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,938
and I just found out I snore.

1144
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,608
Enough with the overreacting.

1145
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:06,702
Doctor, over here!

1146
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,539
Nurse, Ms. Cheon has collapsed!

1147
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,875
Hurry! Please hook her up
to a monitor now!

1148
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,628
Excuse me! Coming through!

1149
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,110
Dr. Ku, this is for you.

1150
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,362
Hey, you're back.

1151
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,531
The fellow from Songdo Yulje
asked me to give this to you.

1152
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,951
She said it was important
and to deliver it quickly.

1153
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,204
She asked you to call her
once you receive it.

1154
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:52,289
Okay.

1155
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,094
Right. I almost forgot about this.

1156
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,680
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

1157
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:09,306
Goodbye.

1158
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:12,518
Dr. Oh, watch the surgery?
You haven't seen a twin delivery yet.

1159
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,686
Well…

1160
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:22,236
That's okay.

1161
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:24,697
I'll get going.

1162
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,865
All right, then. Bye.

1163
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,159
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

1164
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,911
- Please bring the patient.
- Okay.

1165
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,085
Dr. Oh.

1166
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:41,880
Hello.

1167
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,759
Did you know Dr. Joo got an earful
from our professor because of you?

1168
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:47,928
Sorry?

1169
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,935
What does "general" mean?

1170
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,521
I'm asking what "general" means.

1171
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,359
General anesthesia--

1172
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:05,154
"General" includes
both general and spinal anesthesia.

1173
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,156
You know there are two, right?

1174
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,200
But if you just say "general,"

1175
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,954
how are we supposed to know
if it's general or spinal?

1176
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,667
You need to communicate
properly and precisely.

1177
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,253
These are basic fundamentals.

1178
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:27,885
Until now, we've always used
"spinal" for spinal anesthesia.

1179
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,679
Only general anesthesia
was called "general."

1180
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:32,765
So I did exactly that.

1181
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,266
So it's our mistake?

1182
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,354
Then repeat exactly what you said
at that time.

1183
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,066
Say it again.
Let's get to the bottom of this.

1184
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,525
Doctor, at the time, I--

1185
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,945
Wait. Do you not remember what you said?

1186
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,406
Say it again. Let me hear it.

1187
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,037
Go ahead.

1188
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,586
Say it.

1189
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,674
Repeat exactly what you said at that time.

1190
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,643
"Ms. Jang Mi-hwa."

1191
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:21,397
"Her baby's heart rate isn't good,
so please use general."

1192
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,402
That's exactly the same
as what I said today.

1193
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,364
I don't understand
what the problem is, Doctor.

1194
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,282
What?

1195
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:38,497
Then… why was the preparation wrong?

1196
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:41,625
If you're uncomfortable
with our current way of communication,

1197
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,211
you should discuss that
with our department's professors.

1198
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,505
We've all used this terminology,

1199
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,632
so it's not something
we can resolve at our level.

1200
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:49,716
Well…

1201
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,762
I didn't mean we should change it.

1202
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,184
It's just that things go wrong
whenever she's involved.

1203
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:00,978
I was just double-checking.

1204
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:03,313
Especially after last time.

1205
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:06,108
Last time? What are you referring to?

1206
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,694
Sang-hyeon told me

1207
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:12,030
that to get an OR
for a C-section at night,

1208
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,575
Dr. Oh lied and said it was an emergency.

1209
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,160
Isn't that ridiculous?

1210
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,370
Dr. Kim, about that--

1211
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,621
That's not true.

1212
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,832
That might've been the outcome,

1213
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,710
but Dr. Oh wouldn't have lied
to secure an OR.

1214
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,546
Our first-years don't work that way.

1215
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:31,425
I never taught them that,
and that's never happened before.

1216
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:34,428
Dr. Myeong here would know too.

1217
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:38,265
What?

1218
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:42,311
Right. Actually,
I was going to mention this.

1219
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,771
I guess there was
a bit of a mix-up that day.

1220
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:47,232
Sorry.

1221
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,486
Well, it seems like we're all ready.

1222
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,820
I should go scrub in now.

1223
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,663
Did something happen?

1224
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,415
Well…

1225
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,168
Dr. Um told me this.

1226
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,796
When he was with Dr. Oh,

1227
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:13,300
Dr. Myeong called
and said it was an emergency.

1228
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,179
That's why Dr. Oh made the urgent request.

1229
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,097
Yes, I heard that too.

1230
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:21,517
Really?

1231
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:23,977
In that case,

1232
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,146
you should've told me.

1233
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:27,731
I apologize.

1234
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,151
I really didn't lie.

1235
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,612
I'm not that kind of person.

1236
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,741
But it's true that we did cause trouble
for Anesthesiology.

1237
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:39,826
I'd like to apologize for that.

1238
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,914
We'll make sure
such misunderstandings won't happen again.

1239
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:47,543
And,

1240
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,880
from now on,
I'll discipline our first-years myself.

1241
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,552
If they do something wrong,
please tell me directly.

1242
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,387
I'll scold them myself.

1243
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,724
All right, then.

1244
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,727
Let's hurry up and get ready.

1245
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:14,695
Are you going to stay?

1246
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,159
Yes.

1247
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,628
RECOVERY ROOM

1248
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,546
Doctor.

1249
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,676
Is my baby okay? Is everything all right?

1250
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,635
Yes.

1251
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,805
Can I go see my baby?

1252
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:43,765
I'm feeling okay.

1253
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,267
No, you can't.

1254
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:46,893
I mean…

1255
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:53,483
You need to rest
for about six to eight hours.

1256
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,987
And you'll feel too dizzy to walk anyway.

1257
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:58,864
I mean…

1258
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,075
It'll be difficult for you to walk.

1259
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:05,579
You

1260
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,415
never change, do you?

1261
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,459
No.

1262
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:19,343
So…

1263
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,805
You said I shouldn't be a doctor,

1264
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,432
so I thought about quitting.

1265
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,895
But I really want to be one.

1266
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,272
It's the only thing I want to do.

1267
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,940
Then do it.

1268
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:37,444
I only said that out of anger.

1269
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:41,490
I'm not someone
who wants to stand in your way.

1270
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,212
I was originally

1271
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,757
supposed to have twins.

1272
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,510
But then I ended up
with only one baby at 30 weeks.

1273
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:04,262
Yes, I read your chart.

1274
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,765
Clothes, pacifiers, strollers…

1275
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,436
I bought two of everything.

1276
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,066
But now I have one extra of everything.

1277
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:19,027
I'm sure no one would want them

1278
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,613
since they belonged to a baby who died.

1279
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:23,824
But I can't bring myself

1280
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:26,910
to throw them away either.

1281
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:32,666
So…

1282
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,505
I'm planning to have another child.

1283
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:41,925
I see.

1284
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,095
Geez. Just the thought

1285
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,765
of doing IVF again makes me sick.

1286
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,107
But I'm going to do it again.

1287
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,154
So, Doctor,

1288
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,031
will you deliver my second baby?

1289
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:19,337
Since it'll be another C-section,

1290
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,757
I'd be extracting the baby,
not delivering it.

1291
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:26,136
And if you get pregnant too soon,
the risk of premature birth increases--

1292
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:27,971
Gosh, I'm apologizing!

1293
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,938
I'm saying I'm sorry, Doctor!

1294
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:38,732
I see.

1295
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,493
I'd like to apologize as well.

1296
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,830
And thank you…

1297
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:56,958
for saying that.

1298
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,096
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1299
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,685
They don't even know I ran away.

1300
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,897
So what am I doing here?

1301
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,446
PYO NAM-KYUNG

1302
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:32,911
<i>Hey!</i>

1303
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:33,912
Geez, you startled me.

1304
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,330
What?

1305
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:37,624
<i>What are you doing? Why aren't you here?</i>

1306
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:38,542
<i>Hurry up.</i>

1307
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,585
<i>Don't you know we need you?</i>

1308
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,797
What do you mean,

1309
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,674
you need me?

1310
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,553
What is it? Did you miss me? A lot?

1311
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:52,722
<i>Whatever. Just get over here this instant.</i>

1312
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,610
I received your document, Doctor.

1313
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,071
Thank you
for bringing our first-year back.

1314
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:09,781
But how did you know?

1315
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,617
I'd never seen a first-year
with a backpack that big

1316
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,035
when transferring a patient.

1317
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:17,330
<i>Be good to her, Do-won. Okay?</i>

1318
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:19,249
Okay, I will.

1319
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,042
By the way…

1320
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,253
I only saw her briefly,
but she seemed pretty decent.

1321
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:25,088
She reminded me of you as a first-year.

1322
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:28,174
Come on, I was like that?
No way. I was good at my job.

1323
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,011
<i>Have a good one. I'm hanging up.</i>

1324
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,387
Okay, bye. Thank you.

1325
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:39,019
You scared me.

1326
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:41,813
Good work today.

1327
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,399
Thanks. You too.

1328
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,446
What is it?

1329
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:52,324
Hurry and go home.

1330
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:55,994
Okay.

1331
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,164
Are you sick or something?

1332
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:00,665
No.

1333
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:04,544
Then go home.

1334
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:06,755
Okay.

1335
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,932
You're coming tomorrow, right?

1336
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,977
You better not run away.

1337
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:28,652
Yes. I'll be here tomorrow.

1338
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:32,697
Not just tomorrow but every single day.
You need to keep at it.

1339
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:34,991
You're not going anywhere.

1340
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,163
Don't forget.

1341
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,378
Yi-young, you're 50 million in debt.

1342
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:48,463
{\an8}Don't forget that.

1343
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:52,217
I better see you tomorrow, Yi-young.

1344
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,385
Bye.

1345
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:13,697
What took you so long? Hurry and sit.

1346
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,573
What? Is something up?

1347
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,575
There's always something going on.

1348
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,332
Hey, did you miss me a lot?
Were you waiting a long time?

1349
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:25,875
Yeah, we totally missed you.

1350
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,419
Really? Why?

1351
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,046
Don't you know?
We can't go home without you.

1352
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:33,842
She told us not to call
if all of us weren't present.

1353
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:35,969
She's so cruel.

1354
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:38,805
For the group report?

1355
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:43,643
In any case,
it's true that you need me. Right?

1356
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,437
- Of course.
- That goes without saying.

1357
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,984
MYEONG EUN-WON

1358
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:54,487
I'll go first.

1359
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:02,203
{\an8}Hello, Dr. Myeong.
I have nothing to report today.

1360
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,788
{\an8}I didn't tend to any patients.

1361
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,834
- Sorry?
- What? Do we have to start over?

1362
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:09,127
How? He has nothing to report.

1363
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:10,670
Maybe she doesn't understand.

1364
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:12,922
I see. Thank you.

1365
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,552
She said we don't have to do
group reports anymore.

1366
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:18,553
What?

1367
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:20,680
Senior residents
will report everything themselves!

1368
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,098
- Really?
- Yeah.

1369
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,516
Does that mean…

1370
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:25,310
We can go home!

1371
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,395
What are you guys doing?
Hurry up and get changed!

1372
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,481
Hurry up. Let's go.

1373
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,404
It's hot. Why is it so hot?

1374
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,406
Because it's a hot Americano.

1375
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:40,658
By the way,

1376
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:44,245
how did you convince Dr. Myeong
to stop taking reports?

1377
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,873
She's notorious for being unreasonable.

1378
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,462
It's the price for me
turning a blind eye to what she did.

1379
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:54,631
- What?
- You don't have to know.

1380
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:59,135
Does this mean I can start
assigning work to Jae-il tomorrow?

1381
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:01,846
I can't keep doing his work any longer.

1382
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,099
Okay, you're all clear starting from now.

1383
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,683
They'll stick around for a while.

1384
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,812
It's all thanks
to my food shuttle service.

1385
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:11,981
A full stomach makes you happy
and keeps you from wanting to quit.

1386
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:13,817
No, Doctor. It's all about sleep.

1387
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,529
A good sleep resets your mood.

1388
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,614
To put Dr. Um to sleep,

1389
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:21,616
I assisted in surgeries
and wrote up charts.

1390
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,327
And I didn't want him
feeling hurt in the ward,

1391
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,746
so I tried really hard to keep him away.

1392
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,252
It's neither food nor sleep.

1393
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:34,212
Is this your first day?

1394
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,006
You don't know anything.

1395
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:41,302
Gosh, it's hot!

1396
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:43,179
Are you stupid?

1397
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:47,851
It's today.

1398
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:50,311
Today is the day.

1399
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,396
What day?

1400
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:53,565
It's payday.

1401
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,154
That's right. No wonder.

1402
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,739
- I was in a particularly good mood today.
- Right.

1403
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,284
Speaking of which,
let's go out for dinner.

1404
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,788
It's my treat.
I do earn a bit more than you.

1405
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:11,082
- Really?
- Okay? Let's go.

1406
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,459
Yes! Let's get something expensive!

1407
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,711
I know a place.

1408
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:17,172
I got my paycheck!

1409
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:19,424
Hey, did you get yours too?

1410
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:20,341
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1411
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:22,802
And I'm still in the red. What a drag.

1412
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:28,224
Isn't it tradition to buy our parents
long johns with our first paycheck?

1413
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,852
Sa-bi, what are you going to do?

1414
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:33,605
Who buys long johns these days?
Thermal clothing is the trend.

1415
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,566
I'm going to put all this money
into booking a summer vacation.

1416
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:37,567
We get vacations?

1417
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:40,486
Of course. What kind of job
doesn't have vacations?

1418
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,031
I'm hungry.

1419
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:44,741
I haven't eaten all day.

1420
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:47,702
Hey, should we have dinner together
to celebrate our first paycheck?

1421
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:50,455
The pasta place across the street
is probably open until late.

1422
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,792
Isn't pasta a bit heavy at night?

1423
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:56,586
I don't eat much at night.

1424
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,505
I eat alone in the evening.
It's what I prefer.

1425
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,135
I'll get going first.

1426
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,053
Okay.

1427
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:06,304
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

1428
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:10,934
Next time.

1429
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,186
We can eat together next time.

1430
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,276
- Hello?
<i>- Dr. Um.</i>

1431
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,529
<i>We're at a pasta place across the street.</i>
<i>If you haven't eaten--</i>

1432
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:24,822
I'll be there right now.

1433
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,491
Thank you, Doctor.

1434
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,914
{\an8}THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST, AHN EUN-JIN,
OUR ETERNAL CHU MIN-HA

1435
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:18,668
{\an8}RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1436
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:21,254
<i>First-years have a lot to do.</i>

1437
01:28:21,337 --> 01:28:24,590
<i>They're still a bit slow,</i>
<i>so it takes longer to do things.</i>

1438
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:27,218
You see, I'm still a first-year resident.

1439
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:30,179
I can't tell you
anything definitive right now.

1440
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:32,140
{\an8}You all kept saying you didn't know, so…

1441
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:35,643
{\an8}How do you know
even less than your patient?

1442
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,271
{\an8}Is that so difficult?
These are the basics!

1443
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:40,356
{\an8}<i>Whenever things get a little hard,</i>
<i>you show it.</i>

1444
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,233
{\an8}You can't even get that right?

1445
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,944
{\an8}How can we not show
we're struggling when it's hard?

1446
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,529
{\an8}Forcing yourself to work is hard.

1447
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:47,655
{\an8}You little brat!

1448
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:51,242
{\an8}<i>What's the point of just filling your head</i>
<i>with reading and studying?</i>

1449
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,536
{\an8}<i>The real world isn't just about studying.</i>

1450
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:55,288
{\an8}<i>Look at you, Um Jay!</i>

1451
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:57,248
{\an8}Me? Is that for me?

1452
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,417
{\an8}Wouldn't he be the first
among OB-GYN first-years?

1453
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,544
{\an8}<i>If you're not sure, just say this.</i>

1454
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:03,254
{\an8}What's so simple about this solution?

1455
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,422
{\an8}<i>You don't know either.</i>

1456
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,174
{\an8}<i>Isn't this profound?</i>

1457
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:07,425
{\an8}<i>Where's Ku Do-won?</i>

1458
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,093
{\an8}<i>I don't see the chief resident.</i>

1459
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,970
{\an8}<i>He kept looking and smiling.</i>

1460
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,180
{\an8}<i>What else could it be?</i>

1461
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:15,558
{\an8}<i>It's love.</i>

1462
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,527
