00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,030
{\an8}EPISODE 1

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:31,948
{\an8}<i>BP is dropping.</i>

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,993
{\an8}BP is 80 over 60. Heart rate is 130.
Respiration is 30.

5
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,245
Start another line
in the other arm for fluid loading.

6
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,705
- Yes, sir.
- Sir!

7
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,124
{\an8}<i>Sir, open your eyes! Are you awake?</i>

8
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,043
<i>Sir, can you hear me?</i>

9
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,420
Okay, let's move him.

10
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,671
One, two, three!

11
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,215
Sir, do you know where you are?

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,633
Could you try opening your eyes?

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,593
BP is dropping.

14
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,471
Starting CPR.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,308
What's going on?

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,643
{\an8}TA patient, with mental status stupor,
went into arrest,

17
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,853
{\an8}so I'm performing CPR.

18
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,063
{\an8}- Open him up.
- Here?

19
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,565
{\an8}It'll be a table death
if we don't do it now.

20
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,608
{\an8}Open him up. Hurry.

21
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,610
Wait. Me?

22
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,279
- But I'm just an intern--
- Get it together!

23
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,578
If we don't stop the internal bleeding,
he won't survive.

24
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,496
Don't you know that?

25
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,709
Don't just stand there! Do it now!

26
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,639
We'll perform simultaneous surgeries.
I'll lower the intracranial pressure.

27
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,558
Dr. Oh, perform cardiac massage
directly with your hands.

28
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,436
But I don't even have gloves on.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,314
Does that matter right now?
That's not what's important.

30
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,399
Then what is important?

31
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,526
What's important is…

32
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,240
You gave up being a doctor.

33
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,616
You quit.

34
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,868
You're

35
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,703
not a doctor anymore.

36
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,768
You gave up being a doctor.

37
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,853
You quit.

38
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,815
You're not even a doctor.
What are you even doing here?

39
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,817
Oh Yi-young, you're not a doctor.

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,069
<i>- Ms. Oh?</i>
- Dr. Oh.

41
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,946
<i>- Ms. Oh?</i>
- Dr. Oh!

42
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,197
Ms. Oh?

43
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,287
Are you okay?

44
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,249
You must've been dreaming.

45
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,960
Yes, it was a nightmare.

46
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,086
Oh, dear.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,048
Geez, I just had to dream
something like that…

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,803
I'm never going back.

49
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,390
If I ever do, it'll be over my dead body.

50
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,060
This premium package
is only for our VIP clients.

51
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:10,231
We'll finish the massage
with this gold-infused natural oil.

52
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,858
Okay.

53
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,908
How much is this though?

54
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,077
It's the package you've always chosen.

55
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,456
How much was it again?

56
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,499
A hundred?

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,795
One… one million won?

58
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,924
Since you added foot care today,
it's 1.2 million.

59
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,259
Hold on.

60
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,845
That's strange. I should be broke.

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,889
Come on. I know you're not.

62
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,016
But my dad went
totally bankrupt last year.

63
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,685
Come on.
You must still have a little bit left.

64
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,563
I doubt it. I likely maxed out
my overdraft account too.

65
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,608
I see.

66
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,276
You spent it all.

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,736
So you have no money.

68
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,240
Then you won't have any money
either today, tomorrow, or in the future?

69
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:01,950
That's right.

70
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,123
Then you give me no choice.

71
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,959
Sorry?

72
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,425
If you don't have money,
you'll have to work it off.

73
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,927
That's how the world works.

74
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,973
Hold on.

75
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,599
What is this? Don't! Stop!

76
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,767
In this world,

77
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,397
there are things you have to do
even if you don't want to, Dr. Oh.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,816
For example, earning money.

79
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,694
No, I have money. I do…

80
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,696
Really! I do have money!

81
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,366
No. You don't.

82
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,827
All right. Shall we start
with the kidneys?

83
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,453
- Music.
- Yes, ma'am.

84
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,250
{\an8}No! Stop!

85
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,426
Stop…

86
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,970
No. Wait.

87
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,808
Not the saw.

88
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,454
{\an8}Hello?

89
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,415
{\an8}I'm driving right now.

90
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,920
{\an8}What was that? Could you repeat…

91
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,758
Ms. Oh Yi-young.

92
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,635
{\an8}You're currently using
our bank's overdraft account.

93
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,221
{\an8}It looks like your due date is next week.

94
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,059
{\an8}We've tried to contact you several times,
but you must've been very busy.

95
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,896
Yes.

96
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,855
A little bit.

97
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,482
I see. Currently,

98
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,485
you can either repay
the overdraft amount of 50 million won

99
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,652
- or--
- Wait.

100
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,029
I used up all 50 million?

101
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,284
The total balance
is negative 46,407,000 won, ma'am.

102
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,997
If immediate repayment is difficult,
you can extend the loan period.

103
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,874
Then I'll do that.

104
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,459
All right, ma'am.

105
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,755
If you bring your certificate
of employment by next week--

106
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,257
{\an8}I don't have one.

107
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,219
{\an8}Then what about your previous year's
tax withholding statement?

108
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,720
{\an8}I don't have that either.

109
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,138
Do you have a job at the moment?

110
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,435
Then, when do you plan on working again?

111
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,231
It's not that I don't want to work.
I just can't.

112
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,649
I tried.

113
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,985
But I don't think
the working environment suits me.

114
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,779
It's too hard.

115
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,659
So it doesn't suit you.

116
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,123
Then, in that case…

117
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,794
{\an8}Once the due date passes,
and depending on the credit card company,

118
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,380
{\an8}your card may be suspended
and your limit may be reduced.

119
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,465
{\an8}As creditor,
the bank may request the courts

120
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,134
{\an8}for an investigation of assets.

121
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,552
{\an8}Then assets could be frozen.

122
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:11,722
{\an8}And after that, there may be legal action
and seizure of assets, ma'am.

123
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,231
What did you say I needed again?

124
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,651
{\an8}- A certificate…
- A certificate?

125
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,153
{\an8}…of employment.

126
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,863
Of employment.

127
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,866
A certificate of employment.

128
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
A certificate of employment.

129
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,676
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

130
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,529
{\an8}What's taking you so long?

131
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,287
{\an8}You're going out like that?

132
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,707
{\an8}Joo-young, these pants are latest--

133
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,917
{\an8}Right. They're nice.

134
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,919
{\an8}We'll be late. Let's go.

135
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,425
{\an8}By the way…

136
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,094
{\an8}Do I really have to go?

137
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,804
{\an8}Damn it.

138
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,933
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

139
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,353
At least it feels familiar
since you interned here, right?

140
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,270
I guess.

141
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,314
At least we won't get lost.

142
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,483
Let go of me. I'm not a child.

143
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,152
This isn't my first rodeo.

144
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,446
I need to see you go inside
with my own eyes.

145
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,741
You're smart, so I know you'll do well.

146
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,035
You'll find it fulfilling
and make money too.

147
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,997
Right, you'll even be able
to make friends. How great is that?

148
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,165
Whatever.

149
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,543
Who was it that scammed Dad again?

150
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,878
A friend of 50 years
who stole five billion won.

151
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,506
Good. I'm glad you brought it up.

152
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,343
He's not the only one who went broke.
You did too. You're dirt-poor.

153
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,554
You have no home or car.
Just debts. So shut it.

154
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,141
Still, it's embarrassing
to come back here.

155
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,311
Use your brain for once, will you?

156
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,647
He can't open a hospital for you anymore.

157
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,940
You can't be a director.

158
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,151
And what hospital would take you
after that huge mess you made?

159
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,488
You think you can go to any university
or local hospital there is?

160
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,533
That's why I'm back here.

161
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,161
If it weren't for me, you would've missed
applying for the additional recruitment.

162
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,205
You should be thanking me.

163
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,165
All right.

164
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,959
I'll go in.

165
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,877
Geez.

166
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,881
Just hang in there
until you repay the 50 million won.

167
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,799
After that…

168
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,263
Whatever! We'll talk again
after you pay it back.

169
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,558
You quit before repaying your debt,

170
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,978
and you'll be lying in the morgue.
Got that?

171
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,650
Geez, I can't stand looking at you.
Get in there!

172
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,112
Bye.

173
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,132
You little…

174
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,056
Just one year.

175
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,475
Please just hang in there for one year.

176
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,073
Just a moment!

177
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,201
Wait!

178
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>- Going up.</i>
- Thank you.

179
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,046
- We're getting off.
- Excuse me.

180
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,772
It's so nice to see you here.

181
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,440
{\an8}Sure.

182
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,485
{\an8}The lounge moved
to the fifth floor last year.

183
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,237
Please pretend you don't know me.

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,031
I was just letting you know
since you seemed unaware.

185
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,533
As a fourth-year to a first-year.

186
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,744
You can tell the other first-years.
Don't tell me anything.

187
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,996
It's weirder
that you're making such a fuss.

188
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,249
All right.

189
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,210
Don't complain I didn't help later.

190
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,753
That's never going to happen.

191
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,386
No, to your right.

192
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,989
{\an8}RESIDENT LOUNGE

193
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,366
{\an8}AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

194
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,291
Yes, I'm on my way.

195
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,073
OB-GYN, FIRST-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE
2023 OB-GYN RESIDENT RECRUITMENT

196
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,264
- Good morning.
- Hello.

197
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,557
Hi.

198
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,893
You all look so different
in your lab coats.

199
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,894
Take a seat.

200
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,357
Thank you.

201
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,234
I'm a fourth-year resident, Ku Do-won.

202
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,402
This is third-year resident,
Dr. Ki Eun-mi.

203
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,279
This is second-year resident,
Dr. Cha Da-hye.

204
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,406
They'll be your saviors today.

205
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,324
Say hi.

206
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,659
Hi, guys.

207
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,287
Today's your first day,
so let's do introductions.

208
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:54,917
What?

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,211
Wow, is this real?

210
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,713
It's ancient history, but--

211
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,674
The top student is joining our department?

212
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,052
Which "top" were you referring to?

213
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,055
I was top student in med school
and got the top score on national exams.

214
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,894
I'm Kim Sa-bi.

215
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,521
I read Prof. Seo Jung-min's paper

216
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,149
on "Pre-eclampsia Prediction Algorithm
Using Machine Learning" last March

217
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,360
and became interested
in the OB-GYN department.

218
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,404
And last month, after I read her paper

219
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,740
on "Pregnancy Complications
and Fetal Programming in the Uterus,"

220
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,200
that cemented my decision.

221
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,161
I look forward to working with you.

222
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,872
{\an8}You're better than your seniors.

223
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,498
{\an8}She published another paper?

224
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,375
- Beats me.
- Next up…

225
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,047
This has to be a real first.

226
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,675
That's right. It's not common.

227
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,012
You two attended the same high school?
Did you know each other?

228
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,891
We both went to Baejin High School.

229
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,062
Nam-jeong?

230
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,105
Nam-kyung.

231
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,232
Right, Nam-kyung.
We were classmates in junior year.

232
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,901
Classmates in senior year.

233
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,111
You're right. Sorry.

234
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,697
Jung Nam-kyung?

235
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,782
Pyo Nam-kyung.

236
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,289
Dr. Pyo, it looks like you stopped
dying your hair halfway through.

237
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,750
Why? Did you run out of money? Or time?

238
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,168
This is the trend.

239
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,671
If I untie it,
you can't see the dyed part.

240
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,674
So when the professors are around,
I'll keep my hair down.

241
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,718
When they're not, I'll have it tied.

242
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,261
Different styles?

243
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,680
You'll be quite busy.
Okay, introduce yourself.

244
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,684
Hello, I'm Pyo Nam-kyung.

245
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:40,189
I may look like an uptight city slicker,
but I'm actually pretty easygoing.

246
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,441
I hope we can all get along well.

247
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,526
- All right.
- Thank you.

248
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,903
Next…

249
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,531
Dr. Oh Yi-young.

250
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,993
I'm Oh Yi-young. I'm 28 years old.

251
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,162
That's it.

252
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,044
The thing about Dr. Oh is…

253
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,547
She interned and started
her residency here two years ago,

254
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,883
and then went to a local hospital.

255
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,553
Simply put,
she's repeating a year as a resident.

256
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,472
- I see.
- I see.

257
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,268
Well, she's back now.
That's what matters, right?

258
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,563
You're all in the same year,
so try to get along. Okay?

259
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,233
And lastly…

260
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,240
Yes, it's me.

261
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,242
Dr. Um, your coat is inside out.

262
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,537
No one usually makes that mistake.

263
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,747
- Right.
- Introduce yourself first.

264
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,377
Hello! I'm Um Jae-il,
and I'm 28 years old.

265
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,421
My stage name is Um Jay.

266
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,381
Stage name? Why a stage name?

267
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,507
"Umji"?

268
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,467
Like in the Korean phrase for "thumbs up"?

269
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,761
No. It's Um Jay.

270
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,139
Um. J-A-Y.

271
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,391
- He's our first foreigner, right?
- Yes.

272
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,517
I'm not a foreigner.

273
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,437
- What?
- I'm like a one-hit wonder.

274
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,856
From an old music group.

275
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,400
- I was in an old K-pop idol group--
- That's right!

276
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,943
Cha Eun-woo's group.

277
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,111
No, not that one.

278
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,196
No, it's that actor. What was his name?

279
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,948
- Yim Si-wan. His group.
- Oh, that.

280
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,116
No, not ZE:A either.

281
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,910
We were called HI-BOYZ.

282
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,245
We did this.

283
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,626
Right! You might've seen this one.

284
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,470
Basically, you're saying
you used to be a K-pop idol?

285
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,222
Fine. Say something quick
and wrap it up. I'm busy.

286
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,974
Yes, sir.

287
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,519
I might not be the best at studying,
but I'm good at physical work.

288
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,147
I'll keep going
until the soles of my feet wear out.

289
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,482
I'd appreciate your support.

290
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,152
All right.
Anyways, we're glad you're all here.

291
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,195
Let's give them a hand!

292
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,112
Clap, clap.

293
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,575
Since it's your first day,

294
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,328
our senior residents
will help you a lot today.

295
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,080
But since they're also busy,

296
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,874
let's not ask the same questions
or make the same mistakes twice.

297
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,833
Yes, sir!

298
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,420
But always ask if you don't know something
and check things that are unclear.

299
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,463
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

300
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,591
If your mistake comes all the way to me,
it means you messed up big time.

301
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,843
So let's hope we don't meet again today.

302
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,221
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

303
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,889
- Dismissed.
- Dismissed!

304
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,893
Good luck.

305
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,061
Have a nice day.

306
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,020
Goodbye.

307
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,539
I'm heading up to the Gynecology ward.

308
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,207
Good luck.

309
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,379
Right, I have to go to the ward too.

310
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,547
See you later.

311
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,591
Hello.

312
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,469
Hey, I'm a bit disappointed though.

313
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,721
We were the top two students
at Baejin High.

314
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,973
We were archrivals.

315
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,308
We were?

316
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,185
I guess not.

317
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,608
You don't believe what our classmates said

318
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,777
about me following you
to med school, do you?

319
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,445
That's news to me.

320
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,623
- The operating room?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,917
- Whose surgery?
- Prof. Seo Jung-min's.

322
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,628
Yikes. Surgery on your first day
with Seo Jung-min?

323
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,632
Don't you remember? You interned here.

324
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,093
No, I don't remember.

325
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,348
Hey, I'll let you in on something
since we're old classmates.

326
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,854
They say a notorious endemic disease
is going around here.

327
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,022
The "Bitchy Disease."

328
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,024
Seo Jung-min's terminal.

329
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,110
She tears you down with her words
and eyes over and over again.

330
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,155
- She's that scary?
- Yeah.

331
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,824
If you get on her bad side,
she'll criticize you all day.

332
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,994
She's out to torment us.

333
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,958
You know what her nickname is?

334
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,597
Hello.

335
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,058
So we have a new first-year resident.

336
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,726
Welcome.

337
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,646
Did our junior resident watch
the surgery videos in advance?

338
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,730
I did.

339
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,191
Just your luck
to get me on your first day.

340
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,901
Did you hear that my nickname is

341
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,070
- "The Witch"?
- Yes.

342
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,700
Who told you?

343
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,451
First-year resident Pyo Nam-kyung.

344
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,371
What a helpful colleague she is.

345
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,044
By the way, junior. Isn't your vision
blurry and hazy right now?

346
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,630
- It is.
- You can't see in front of you

347
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,340
and things look out of focus?

348
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,842
Yes, how did you…

349
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,760
How did you know that?

350
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,596
Right? I wonder how.

351
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,140
Ma'am.

352
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,275
Right.

353
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,570
Thank you.

354
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,238
{\an8}Ma'am, she's been contaminated.

355
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,371
{\an8}We need to deliver the baby quickly
since it's general anesthesia.

356
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,249
{\an8}We'll make the incision
right after intubation.

357
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,500
Dr. First-Year.

358
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,127
Pay close attention.

359
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,545
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,467
I'll start the time-out checklist.

361
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,886
Can the anesthesiologist
verify the patient?

362
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,847
Yes, registration number 19210681.

363
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,891
Patient name, Sung Hui-young.

364
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,769
{\an8}- Diagnosis and procedure?
- Placenta previa totalis.

365
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,688
{\an8}A low flap transverse cesarean section
will be performed.

366
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,608
{\an8}- Do we have fetal cord blood sampling?
- No.

367
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,526
- Is everything correct?
- Yes.

368
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,987
- Beginning anesthesia.
- Okay.

369
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,449
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

370
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,174
Richardson retractor.

371
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,551
Meyer forceps.

372
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,815
Pull. One, two, three.

373
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,527
Bladder retractor.

374
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,070
Metzenbaum.

375
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,871
Scalpel.

376
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,297
I'll apply fundal pressure.

377
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,049
APPLYING PRESSURE
ON THE TOP OF THE UTERUS

378
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,269
The baby is out.

379
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,312
{\an8}Hi!

380
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,523
{\an8}Time is 10:23 a.m. It's a baby girl.

381
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,152
- Is the baby okay?
- Yes, Apgar score is nine.

382
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,821
Saturation level is good,
and her pulse is over 100.

383
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,742
Hey, junior.

384
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,412
You used two pairs
of gloves on your first day.

385
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,454
What a busy day, right?

386
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,583
Do-won, I'll leave the rest to you.

387
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,584
Yes, ma'am.

388
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,295
- Good work, everyone.
- Thank you.

389
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,599
<i>Was her name Oh Yi-young?</i>

390
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,559
The one who caused trouble
at a local hospital?

391
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,853
Yeah, that's her.
I felt bad for her though.

392
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,022
She had Prof. Seo on her first day.

393
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,024
I think she's already on her bad side.

394
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,734
Geez, what awful luck.

395
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,485
That's just her fate.

396
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,946
And the surgery's over now, right?

397
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,740
That's just how you pass the days.

398
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,037
It's not over.
We're packed with OB surgeries today.

399
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,083
But seriously, what'll she do?

400
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,461
Isn't it obvious? She'll have to bear it.

401
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,147
Make way! She's in labor! Move aside!

402
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,693
Slow down. You're going too fast.

403
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,321
No, hurry up! Quick!

404
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,241
The baby's coming!

405
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,789
Hello?

406
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,541
I'll come up right away.

407
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,006
Where have you been?

408
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,549
Here.

409
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,177
You're the first.

410
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,554
All right.

411
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:04,020
"I wish you happiness."

412
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,066
I was checking
Mr. Yoon I-sang's biopsy result.

413
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,442
I see.

414
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,236
What is this?

415
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,280
My autograph.

416
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,117
You better not sell that online.

417
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,412
Dr. Um, it's a busy day today.

418
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,580
We don't have time to joke around.

419
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,374
These are Cho Seon-yeong's test results.

420
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,002
And you can check
biopsy results on your computer.

421
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,712
You don't have to ask in person.

422
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,342
I was curious about the result.

423
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,636
I thought I could get it faster in person,

424
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,346
but it wasn't out yet.

425
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,277
<i>No way. Jay's a doctor?</i>

426
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,196
<i>I knew it.</i>
<i>He's just as smart as he is sexy.</i>

427
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,948
Doctor.

428
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,658
Yes, hello.

429
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,659
Hello.

430
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,038
I was told to exercise a lot
after the surgery,

431
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,706
so I've been walking around.

432
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,250
But for some reason,

433
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,961
my chest feels uncomfortable
and my shoulder hurts.

434
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,004
Is this normal?

435
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,881
Could you tell me your name?

436
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,132
Yoon Jung-sun.

437
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,844
My shoulder's been hurting
since this morning.

438
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,347
How should I describe it? My chest

439
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,182
feels tight.

440
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,810
Your shoulder and chest area feel stiff.

441
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,896
And you feel short of breath too?

442
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,356
Yes, that's right.

443
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,524
Is this normal after surgeries?

444
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,736
One moment, please.

445
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,703
Hello, Dr. Cha.
I'm sorry to call you for the fifth time.

446
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,623
I think I found
a case of aortic dissection.

447
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,916
<i>What? What did you say?</i>

448
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,503
{\an8}A tear in the aorta.

449
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,712
{\an8}<i>I'm coming now.</i>

450
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,173
{\an8}<i>- Did she get a chest CT scan?</i>
- Right, a CT scan.

451
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,634
Have you gotten a chest CT scan?

452
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,135
What's that?

453
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,846
<i>Hold on. Who are you talking to right now?</i>

454
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,432
The patient is standing
in front of me right now.

455
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,936
An aortic dissection patient

456
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,523
is standing in front of you?

457
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,982
Yes, she's here right now.

458
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,442
<i>Dr. Um.</i>

459
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,402
Yes, Doctor?

460
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,153
<i>Are you kidding me right now?!</i>

461
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,571
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

462
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,448
FIRST-YEAR

463
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,910
I think being lazy might be better.

464
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,329
He's too eager for his own good.

465
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,455
Isn't that a good thing?

466
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,832
He's always busy.

467
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,960
He meets with patients,
asks questions, and takes notes.

468
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,295
Then he does it over and over again.

469
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,297
But he never gets anything right.

470
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,842
We were also like him once.
Don't you remember last March?

471
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,053
- I don't think I was like that.
- Yeah, you were. I'm a witness.

472
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,683
Still, I'm sure he has
at least one good quality.

473
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,853
He's hard-working.

474
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,730
And his flaw?

475
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,024
He's hard-working.

476
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,572
This too shall pass.

477
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,365
Summer will be here in a flash.

478
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,498
FIRST-YEAR

479
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,962
What is it now, Dr. Um?

480
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,173
So,

481
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,510
we won't know until we have the surgery?

482
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,428
Yes.

483
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,765
If you look at Section 2-1
of the procedure explanation,

484
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,934
after incising the skin,
we'll assess the extent of the illness

485
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,021
in the abdominal cavity and determine
which organs need to be removed.

486
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,814
I see.

487
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,066
Doctor.

488
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,651
It's…

489
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,071
it's not that difficult

490
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,158
of a surgery, is it?

491
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,832
If we find cancer during surgery,
the extent of the surgery may increase.

492
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,178
Excuse me.

493
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,847
Surgery will take 4 to 5 hours
according to textbooks

494
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,892
with approximately
a 30% chance of complications.

495
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,603
{\an8}Could you please sign here?

496
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,323
I'm sorry.

497
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,584
I caught you right at mealtime.

498
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,294
Enjoy your dinner.

499
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,012
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

500
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,404
Is that too little? Want more?

501
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,405
No, thanks.

502
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,365
The line's long. Keep moving forward.

503
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,908
Spinach?

504
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,702
Go. Grilled short rib patties?

505
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,870
- Five, please.
- Five…

506
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,788
Really?

507
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,545
- Bean sprouts?
- Three.

508
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,966
- Tofu.
- One?

509
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,017
At least you got a meal break
between surgeries today.

510
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,060
Consider yourself lucky.

511
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,271
Eat up.

512
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,732
What time do we get off today?

513
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,611
At this rate…

514
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,614
Gosh, not on time.

515
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,157
Damn it.

516
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,619
Why do we come to work on time
but never leave on time?

517
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,872
Make sure you eat up.

518
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,509
She's bleeding.

519
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,595
What are you doing, junior?

520
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,764
- Kleenex.
- Kleenex?

521
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,390
What's the English word again?

522
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,433
Tissue, please.

523
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,145
{\an8}There are no tissues
in the operating room. It's gauze.

524
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,272
You're too relaxed for your first day.

525
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,524
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,862
Cut.

527
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,162
Is that a souvenir?

528
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,747
Throw it away.

529
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,832
Do I have to tell you that too?

530
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,800
Junior, why put it there
when you can throw it away?

531
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,103
What hospital taught you to put it there?

532
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,521
- At Jongno Yulje--
- Hey!

533
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,567
Objects could end up in the patient
if you leave them in the surgical field!

534
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,694
Get rid of it now!

535
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,717
I'll hold it tight
and throw it away later outside.

536
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,637
Take the suture and leave right now.

537
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,975
Get out of the field right now!

538
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,949
Damn it.

539
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,208
I never said you could move.

540
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,128
I told you to stand there
and watch carefully.

541
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,506
- I have eyes in the back of my head.
- Yes, ma'am.

542
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,425
Cut.

543
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,643
Damn it.

544
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,829
Excuse me, Dr. Cha.

545
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,123
Knock, knock. Sorry to bother you.

546
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,209
Come in. What is it now?

547
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,922
I just checked
on patient Lee Suk-ja in Room 1014.

548
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,006
And?

549
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,050
Her BP is normal.

550
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,760
And the JP drain?

551
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,474
I'll go check again.

552
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,729
Sure. Off you go.

553
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,820
Excuse me, Dr. Cha.

554
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,196
Knock, knock.

555
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,406
Back already?

556
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,577
It was just across the hall.

557
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,707
The JP drain has minimal drainage
and the color looks fine.

558
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,292
Okay. Good work.

559
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,086
Dr. Cha.

560
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:35,049
Patient Kim Min-suk in Room 1012
has clear fluid leaking from her nose.

561
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,804
{\an8}Post-surgery,
she's had a headache but no fever.

562
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,390
{\an8}But clear fluid is leaking from her nose.

563
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,558
So?

564
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,851
So perhaps…

565
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,144
Perhaps?

566
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,691
…it's a skull fracture?

567
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,028
First, an aortic dissection.

568
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,905
And now, a skull fracture?

569
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,867
Yes, at least that's what I think it is.

570
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:07,206
Ms. Kim had surgery yesterday,
so she's been lying in bed all day.

571
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,960
So how could she have
possibly injured her head?

572
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,837
How? Where?

573
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,380
Why?

574
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,632
I can't tell you that,

575
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,802
but a skull fracture can cause
cerebrospinal fluid to leak from the nose.

576
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,095
I learned that in med school.

577
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,681
So I've been checking
her nasal discharge every 30 minutes.

578
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,308
- Dr. Um.
- Yes?

579
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,894
I wasn't going to say this, but…

580
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,936
Don't you ever get

581
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,646
a runny nose?

582
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,649
- I do.
- You do, right?

583
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,737
We all get it from time to time.
I do. You do.

584
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,197
- Ju-yeon?
- Yes?

585
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,115
- Do you get a runny nose?
- I do.

586
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,533
{\an8}See? Everyone does.

587
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,495
{\an8}Patients get it.
Doctors get it. Nurses get it.

588
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,666
{\an8}All of humanity gets runny noses!

589
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,335
For crying out loud!

590
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,514
Are you okay, ma'am?

591
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,266
I'm monitoring you carefully.

592
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,226
Doctor.

593
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,603
{\an8}You'll have a safe delivery, ma'am.

594
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,813
{\an8}It's okay. You can count on me.

595
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,398
That's not it.

596
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,691
Sorry?

597
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,527
You're the one
who doesn't seem to be okay.

598
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,239
I'm just really scared too.

599
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,907
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,413
That was Pyo Nam-kyung, right?

601
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,666
Yeah, I think so.

602
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,959
Where are you headed?

603
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,963
{\an8}To get this surgical consent form signed.

604
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,343
Among current residents, I think I may be
the best at getting them signed.

605
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,637
Good for you.

606
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,816
Are you saying you won't sign it?

607
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,734
I won't sign it.

608
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,154
Take it back.

609
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,492
Then would you like
to sign it a little later?

610
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,411
I don't want to receive surgery.

611
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,748
But you need to get it.

612
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,751
You need to sign this right now.

613
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,129
Doctor.

614
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,716
May I ask you something?

615
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,680
You doctors are so smart.

616
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:33,602
There's a bunch of difficult words
written on that consent form,

617
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,522
yet you memorize them all
to explain them to us

618
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,109
and answer any questions we have.

619
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,737
So I have a question.

620
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,239
Why was I…

621
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:52,705
cursed with this terrible illness?

622
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,292
Sorry?

623
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,085
You see…

624
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,921
I never drank

625
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,798
or smoked.

626
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:07,970
{\an8}And I've tried to live
a good, decent life.

627
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,098
I was afraid of getting punished.

628
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,184
So,

629
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,145
why has this happened to me

630
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,232
for the second time now?

631
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,404
Well…

632
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,616
If I knew the reason,

633
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,786
{\an8}at least I wouldn't feel so wronged.

634
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,174
So, what's the reason? Doctor?

635
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,681
Being a good person

636
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,853
and… cancer recurrence

637
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,065
aren't related.

638
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,236
I see.

639
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,185
Hey! Good news!

640
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,770
A blind date?

641
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:42,857
Wrong.

642
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,609
This is even better news.

643
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,361
Better? What is it?

644
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,946
Professor Seo

645
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,198
{\an8}gave us her credit card.

646
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,742
{\an8}- Why?
- She said, for working hard today,

647
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,453
{\an8}we can treat ourselves to good food.

648
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,538
What should we eat? What do you want?

649
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,206
I have dinner plans. Sorry.

650
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,958
See you tomorrow. Bye.

651
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,544
Hey, who has dinner plans this late?

652
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,338
I need to return a book.
Let's eat next time.

653
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,883
Isn't that your book?
Where are you returning…

654
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,148
I'm not hungry.

655
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,860
Enjoy the food.

656
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
I can't eat alone.

657
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,366
{\an8}- Let's eat together next time then.
- Okay.

658
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,744
Good luck.

659
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,832
You should've asked.
I could've driven you.

660
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,718
Prof. Seo is always sensitive
on surgery days.

661
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,556
She doesn't mean anything bad by it,
so I hope you understand.

662
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,267
No, just bear it.

663
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,898
You must be very tired.

664
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,068
No hospital talk at home.

665
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,695
All right.

666
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,074
Why do we have to
keep it secret at work that we're…

667
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,244
Is our relationship weird?

668
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,203
What's so weird?

669
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,330
What good would come of it if they knew?

670
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,501
I could quit at any time.

671
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,086
I doubt it'll be anytime soon.

672
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,422
You're wrong.
I could quit tomorrow if I want.

673
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,840
I doubt it.

674
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,925
God! Stop being so annoying.

675
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,594
Geez, you startled me.

676
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,497
Are you serious?

677
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,710
I didn't do anything.

678
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,256
That's my foot, you know?

679
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,011
It wasn't me.

680
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,262
It was a mouse.

681
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,641
- I heard mice are everywhere these days.
- Really? No wonder.

682
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,392
Here, honey.

683
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,437
Have all the expensive things

684
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,231
before your sister
and this fool eat it all.

685
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,734
You should eat up too.

686
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,737
Just watching you eat
is good enough for me.

687
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:18,989
Seung-won.

688
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,326
Get your heart checked out
at a hospital as soon as possible.

689
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,329
You have to be sick
to still be in love like that.

690
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,165
Hey, I told you
to speak respectfully to him.

691
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:31,251
Seung-won is older than you, okay?
Don't take your anger out on him.

692
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,588
Do-won, where are your table manners?

693
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,715
Why did you kick her?

694
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,593
You're making Yi-young uncomfortable.

695
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,722
I'm sorry. I guess it was me.

696
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,184
{\an8}Just consider this
a way of earning your keep.

697
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,646
Do-won, how was she today?

698
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,563
Did she do well?

699
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,816
Did she cause any trouble?

700
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,567
No, she did fine.

701
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,528
She did well.

702
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,576
So today,
in the operating room, Joo-young--

703
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,536
Don't.

704
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,539
Okay.

705
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,502
What happened?

706
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,257
The professor told her
to throw away a piece of suture,

707
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,342
but she didn't know where to put it.

708
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,803
{\an8}So she went like this, and then--

709
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,929
I told you to stop.

710
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,183
She worked hard.

711
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,268
Don't tell me…

712
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,813
She already fell out of favor
with the professor?

713
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,691
- She can't quit anytime soon.
- Says who?

714
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,069
You can pay back 50 million that quickly?

715
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,779
Is 50 million a joke to you?

716
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:47,077
Also, you should've spent less
if you didn't have any money.

717
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,955
But you splurged left and right
without any thought.

718
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,958
Ever since you started spending
so recklessly, I saw this coming.

719
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,252
Even if you gave the bank
your entire monthly paycheck,

720
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,504
you'd need to work a year
to pay the principal.

721
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,423
Come to your senses, you brat.

722
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,632
Damn it.

723
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,136
You didn't have to
tell them about my debt.

724
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,679
I'm not eating.

725
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,015
Geez. Do-won, have some hairtail.

726
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,642
If it weren't for Do-won,

727
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,853
you would've never gotten
into such a big hospital.

728
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,357
You told me
about the shortage of applicants.

729
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,195
{\an8}While we were eating,

730
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,323
{\an8}I only said our department was short
and was accepting extra applicants.

731
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,576
{\an8}I didn't know you'd apply though.

732
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,747
{\an8}I really didn't think you'd get in.

733
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,754
This is all abuse of power,
school ties, and regional ties.

734
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,713
Everything bad.

735
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,215
What power do I have?

736
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,926
If running my mouth over dinner
counts as power…

737
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,347
Does it count?

738
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,434
What school or regional ties do you have?
Who do you think you are?

739
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,811
It was just good timing.

740
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,064
You only got in thanks to your abilities.

741
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,274
Don't baby her.
That's how she ended up like this.

742
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,651
Who babied me?

743
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,110
Mom and Dad.

744
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,904
And who else? No one.

745
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,156
Grandma. Our aunts and uncle.
There are tons!

746
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,158
Ku Do-won speaking.

747
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,537
{\an8}You're handing over Ms. Eun Sang-mi to me?

748
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,789
{\an8}Okay. I'll come right away.

749
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,793
Do-won, at least finish your meal.

750
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,800
I need to go to the hospital.

751
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,260
Again?

752
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,512
A fellow on vacation asked for a favor.

753
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:30,681
Here.

754
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,812
{\an8}Dr. Oh, I hope to see you tomorrow.

755
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:38,939
Gosh.

756
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,483
He can't even eat in peace.

757
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,027
I don't think he's slept well in days.

758
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,154
I told you this job wasn't worth it.

759
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,116
Geez, you little…

760
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:58,000
{\an8}Check the lab results on the EMR.

761
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,294
You see that monitor?

762
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,089
Monitor the baby's heart rate
and check for uterine contractions.

763
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,841
Notify me if anything seems off.

764
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,135
Make sure to call me, okay?

765
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,139
- Have you been up all night?
- Yeah.

766
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,892
If you're unsure, ask the nurses.

767
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:16,852
Okay.

768
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,687
I'm heading to the operating room.

769
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,982
- I'm going to be alone?
- You want my company?

770
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,276
Gosh. No.

771
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,324
Ms. Lee Young-seon is

772
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,618
Professor Seo's patient.

773
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,330
{\an8}Damn it. The Witch again?

774
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,583
{\an8}Monitor her carefully. We're all dead
if we miss any deceleration.

775
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,756
I'm always stuck with Seo Jung-min.

776
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,636
Doctor!

777
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,224
There's no doctor here.

778
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,728
Doctor! Could you please come here?

779
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,355
There's no one here.

780
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:03,940
Doctor?

781
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,488
Yes, coming.

782
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,034
It's a little cold.

783
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:15,911
Damn it.

784
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,872
Of all the times,
why are you on vacation now?

785
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,667
To say it myself

786
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,212
would be too embarrassing.

787
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,049
No one cared when I mentioned your name.

788
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,677
The doctor in charge?

789
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,181
I see.

790
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:37,808
Okay.

791
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,267
Bye.

792
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,396
Doctor! One moment.

793
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,064
Over here.

794
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,525
So…

795
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,404
Here.

796
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,532
Doctor.

797
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,076
Thank you so much.

798
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:01,832
NOT THE SAME BOYFRIEND AS BEFORE

799
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:02,749
Look…

800
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,877
It's my second time.

801
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,963
But it's a secret.

802
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,305
Okay. I understand.

803
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,223
Honey.

804
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,267
Honey!

805
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,476
Gosh, I'm…

806
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,103
I'm so scared.

807
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,107
I don't know how others
can give birth so smoothly.

808
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,234
What am I going to do?

809
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,777
I'm really nervous too.

810
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,822
Doctor, will we be expecting soon?

811
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,866
Is the baby okay?

812
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,453
Well, she's not dilated at all yet.

813
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,289
The process would be faster
if this was her second or third time…

814
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,959
But it's her first.

815
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,463
So it might take more time.

816
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,674
Let me ask the professor,
and I'll get back to you.

817
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,344
{\an8}Thank you, Doctor.

818
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,429
Thank you.

819
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,806
Also, if she's had a C-section before…

820
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,351
or a natural birth…

821
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,688
Then things might be different.

822
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,648
But since this is her first delivery,

823
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,943
please let me know
if she's in a lot of pain.

824
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,278
Okay, thank you.

825
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,155
{\an8}Thank you.

826
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,032
Wait, Doctor.

827
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,212
Are you done?

828
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,007
Yeah. Eat up.

829
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,014
What a weird fellow.

830
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,934
I only notified 30 minutes late.
Why chew me out for it?

831
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,605
And who goes on vacation in March anyway?

832
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,235
You might as well
just eat with your hands.

833
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,612
Who bought this?

834
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,739
A patient's husband
gave it to me as a thank you.

835
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,575
What's there to thank
a lowly first-year for?

836
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,244
Are you sure it wasn't for a professor?

837
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,705
What did you do today?

838
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,625
Did you do something special?

839
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,169
Nothing much. Just what I was told to do.

840
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,254
I see.

841
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,589
{\an8}I guess you were lucky then.

842
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,425
Guys, can I ask you something?

843
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,553
Ask away. I'll tell you everything.

844
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,474
{\an8}She's a recurrent ovarian cancer patient,

845
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,393
{\an8}but she won't sign
the surgical consent form.

846
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,602
How do I persuade her?

847
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,230
Pass it to a senior resident.
That's what they're there for.

848
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,442
I should still try to solve it myself.

849
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,360
Here!

850
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,865
Ask Prof. Ryu Jae-hui if it's related
to recurrent ovarian cancer.

851
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,367
That's not something
I can ask a professor about.

852
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,244
That'll hurt my pride.

853
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,913
I've asked him 16 times.

854
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,250
Hey, has it been 30 minutes?

855
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,002
Urine. I need to check her urine.

856
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,005
How disgusting.

857
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,468
{\an8}What now?

858
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,806
{\an8}Yes, Doctor?

859
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,601
{\an8}Okay, I'll be right there. Goodbye.

860
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,478
Bye.

861
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,488
I'm on OB duty right now.

862
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,498
Hello?

863
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,670
I have to do that?

864
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,468
Okay, I'll be there.

865
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,370
This is it.

866
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,128
Ma'am.

867
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,507
This could be
very uncomfortable and painful.

868
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,591
Please excuse me.

869
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,063
{\an8}Notify for active labor
if it's 4 cm or more.

870
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,190
{\an8}Notify for full dilation
if it's totally dilated.

871
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,942
{\an8}Check for amniotic sac ruptures.

872
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,658
What on earth?

873
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,410
Why? Why already?

874
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,452
Sorry?

875
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,288
She's…

876
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,873
{\an8}She's all full.

877
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,292
{\an8}FULL DILATION OF THE CERVIX

878
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,088
I'll call the professor.
She's suddenly all full so…

879
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,674
What did you say? She's what?

880
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,343
She's all full.
Ms. Lee Young-seon is at full dilation.

881
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,763
Hi, this is Seo Jung-min.

882
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,349
Get the current patient
out of the delivery room right now.

883
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,393
Another patient needs to give birth first.

884
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,494
{\an8}An all-full patient
didn't receive an epidural,

885
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,164
{\an8}but she's calm enough to ask how I'm doing

886
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,666
with a big smile on her face.

887
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,085
I'm sorry.

888
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,339
The only thing full here is my rage.

889
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,385
I'm sorry.

890
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,638
Ma'am, I just checked.

891
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,182
And you're only 2 cm dilated.

892
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,933
I see.

893
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,435
Let's wait a bit more.

894
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,522
Our first-year resident
must've been very eager to meet the baby.

895
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,857
She was too hasty.

896
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,279
March is really fun, isn't it?

897
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,119
Where did all the residents go?

898
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,623
Here's one.

899
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,209
No, I mean doctors.

900
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,714
Dr. Ku, this is unacceptable.

901
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,174
I'm sorry.

902
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,343
Take better care of the first-years.

903
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,053
Got that?

904
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,513
Yes, I understand.

905
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:43,775
Yes, Doctor?

906
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,778
You still haven't gotten it?

907
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,863
I'll go.

908
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,130
All those patients
had successful surgeries.

909
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,299
They're doing so well
after being discharged.

910
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:14,097
I know you're strong enough
to overcome this.

911
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,895
Did she sign it?

912
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,855
Yeah.

913
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,776
She must've been distraught
over the recurrence.

914
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,736
She just needed some time.

915
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,115
You were one step ahead of me.

916
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,033
I'd figured out how to get her to sign.

917
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,785
- There's a way to do that?
- Yes.

918
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,288
{\an8}<i>Berek & Hacker's Gynecologic Oncology.</i>

919
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,581
It's in this book.

920
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,709
There's a chapter
called "Communication Skills."

921
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,794
"Remove any obstacles
between you and the patient."

922
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,921
"Sit at eye level
within an appropriate distance."

923
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,924
"And quickly offer tissues when they cry."

924
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,009
That's what you did.

925
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,138
I wanted to do the same
and get it signed quickly.

926
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,932
I didn't know that was in the book.

927
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,022
You were worried
she wouldn't get the surgery.

928
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:05,773
Well…

929
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,403
{\an8}Darn it. I wanted to
get it signed under my name.

930
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,322
Too bad.

931
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,244
At least she's having the surgery.

932
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,704
That's good.

933
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,289
You're right, but…

934
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,541
If she'd signed it on the first day,

935
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,085
I wouldn't have wasted time
looking for this useless stuff.

936
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,546
I could've processed things more quickly.

937
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,007
I wanted to get all the consent forms
by 6:00 p.m. today

938
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,343
so I could notify the professor first.

939
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,678
- Sa-bi.
- Yes?

940
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,140
Are you trying to come in first place
at getting consent forms?

941
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,142
What's the point of that?

942
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,897
You can get praised at home or school
for coming in first place,

943
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,690
but this is a hospital.

944
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,652
Here, instead of your own desires,

945
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,238
it's where you put your patients first.

946
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,241
Even medical students know that.

947
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,702
But if you had to look it up
and still didn't understand,

948
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,540
it really was a waste of time.

949
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,252
See you.

950
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,607
Dr. Cha.

951
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,151
What is it?

952
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,946
It's Ms. Yeong Bo-mi in Room 1019.

953
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,032
{\an8}Her urine output has been low
since this morning.

954
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,076
So?

955
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,666
There was significant blood loss
during yesterday's surgery,

956
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,751
and her urine is dark.

957
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,129
What was the urine output
in the last four hours?

958
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:52,547
Well…

959
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,135
I'll go check.

960
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,012
Around 80 cc.

961
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,015
It was about 20 cc per hour
during the early morning.

962
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,434
I wasn't really sure,

963
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:09,188
so I checked by the hour
from 4:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

964
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,483
Her vitals were okay,
and the JP drain looked fine.

965
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:16,070
{\an8}But I requested a CBC just in case.

966
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,782
Did you say from 4:00 a.m.?

967
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:21,743
Yes, ma'am.

968
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,707
{\an8}In conclusion,
I think the patient is dehydrated.

969
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:33,880
{\an8}I'm wondering
if fluid hydration would be a solution.

970
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:39,969
Do that then,

971
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,971
Dr. Um.

972
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,848
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

973
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,392
Where are you going now?

974
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,144
Let me explain it to her first!

975
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,147
Type up the prescription first, please…

976
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,445
Okay.

977
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,241
Nurse, I put in the prescription
for Ms. Yeong.

978
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,159
Okay.

979
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,460
FIRST-YEAR

980
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,047
{\an8}FIRST-YEAR UM JAE-IL

981
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,847
{\an8}Please tell me everything is fine.

982
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,266
Everything is fine.

983
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,604
In that case,

984
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,982
tell me everything will be fine as well.

985
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,985
I can't promise you that.

986
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,368
Who is it this time?

987
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,000
This seems really strange to me too.

988
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,920
She's all full. I think the baby's coming.

989
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,548
- Ma'am, please stay calm…
- I checked, and she's all full.

990
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,633
She's in pain too.

991
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,802
It's really different this time.

992
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,097
Doctor, it hurts too much!

993
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,182
Everyone's either
delivering babies or in surgery.

994
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,267
I'm the only one here.

995
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,476
But she's all full!

996
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,644
<i>Are you sure?</i>

997
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,021
<i>You know what all full is, right?</i>

998
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,232
I'm positive!
I can even see the baby's hair!

999
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,401
Can't you please come now?

1000
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,778
<i>If you're wrong again, Prof. Seo will…</i>

1001
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,281
That's what you're worried about?
Tell her to come right now!

1002
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,327
Hurry!

1003
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,122
<i>Take her to the delivery room.</i>
<i>I'll be there in three minutes. Now.</i>

1004
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,457
Okay.

1005
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,001
- We're moving to the delivery room.
- Okay.

1006
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,920
Ma'am, breathe in short bursts.

1007
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:38,880
Don't push.

1008
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,132
{\an8}Just hold on a little longer.

1009
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:42,884
Doctor.

1010
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,262
This is…

1011
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,724
This is my first time,
so I don't really know, but…

1012
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,018
This is really a first for me.

1013
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,102
What?

1014
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,857
{\an8}Professor, Ms. Lee Young-seon
is all full and at Station 3.

1015
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,275
{\an8}You need to come right away.

1016
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,694
{\an8}<i>I'm coming now.</i>
<i>But why didn't you call sooner?</i>

1017
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,738
I'm sorry. I missed it.

1018
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,908
<i>If it looks like the baby's coming,</i>
<i>handle the delivery in the meantime.</i>

1019
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:07,867
Yes, ma'am.

1020
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:09,535
<i>Hurry.</i>

1021
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,078
Hang in there, ma'am.

1022
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,747
To Delivery Room 2, please.

1023
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,210
Doctor, I think the baby is coming.

1024
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,003
Not yet, ma'am.

1025
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,382
I can't hold it in anymore!

1026
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,636
{\an8}No! Don't!

1027
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,472
No! Hold on!

1028
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,974
Stop! Gloves!

1029
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,336
She delivered.

1030
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,488
What's that sound?

1031
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,199
That's not my patient's baby, right?

1032
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,159
It's not, right?

1033
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,995
This can't be happening, can it?

1034
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,475
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

1035
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,521
Sometimes, babies come out
quicker than expected.

1036
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,565
But you hardly have any tears.

1037
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,317
And the baby is crying well.

1038
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,527
Everything is fine, so don't worry.

1039
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,155
I see. I'm okay.

1040
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:52,657
Congratulations.

1041
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:58,037
{\an8}I feel bad for making that doctor
go through such a hard time.

1042
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,164
I'm sorry.

1043
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,753
- Can you finish up here?
- Yes, Professor.

1044
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,382
You did well, ma'am.

1045
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,592
Thank you.

1046
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,302
Dr. Oh Yi-young!

1047
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,556
Here we are again.

1048
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,142
I'm sorry.

1049
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,604
My patient couldn't even
make it to the delivery room

1050
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,023
and gave birth
in the middle of the hallway.

1051
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:27,733
You see…

1052
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,113
This wasn't her first baby,
so the labor came quicker--

1053
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,490
It doesn't matter
if it was her first or not.

1054
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,367
Even first-timers can go
into labor quickly

1055
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,868
in rapid labor conditions.

1056
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:42,873
Babies can come out suddenly,
unexpectedly, and at any given time.

1057
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,208
Don't you know that?

1058
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,961
Do you know what your mistake was today?

1059
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,010
I made two big mistakes.

1060
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,052
First,

1061
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,848
I didn't monitor the patient carefully
since she was only 2 cm dilated.

1062
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,558
Second,

1063
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,644
I failed to monitor progress,
so I missed the active labor phase

1064
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,022
and couldn't predict the time of delivery.

1065
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:09,984
Those were my two biggest mistakes.

1066
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,945
At least you know.

1067
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,448
I'm sorry.

1068
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,324
Be sure to go

1069
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,411
and say a prayer of thanks today.

1070
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:23,205
For what?

1071
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,541
For the mother and her baby being okay.

1072
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,544
Okay.

1073
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,422
Make one more mistake.

1074
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:33,883
Then…

1075
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,221
I'll show you
what the real Witch looks like.

1076
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,694
FIRST-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE
OB-GYN

1077
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,781
Today's tarot reading was terrible.

1078
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,618
Tomorrow's horoscope is awful too.

1079
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,206
Does anyone have a power bank?

1080
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,054
Here you go.

1081
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,306
Look at you, Um Jae-il.

1082
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,727
I feel drained too.

1083
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,063
How could I not be?

1084
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:31,023
{\an8}My input and output are both at zero.

1085
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,775
An electrolyte imbalance.

1086
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,235
You had cake earlier.

1087
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:39,657
So your input isn't at zero.
I don't know about your output though.

1088
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,869
It's just an expression.

1089
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,831
And I had that cake

1090
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,083
ages ago.

1091
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,585
AI programs show more warmth than you do.

1092
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,217
They said we can go home now.

1093
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,135
Yes!

1094
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,139
I doubt you'll get
any sleep tonight, Yi-young.

1095
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,933
They say you weep and think
of your mom on your first delivery.

1096
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:08,602
Our fellow interns would call
their moms right after delivery.

1097
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,146
Did you call yours too?

1098
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:11,814
No, I couldn't.

1099
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,567
For an experienced patient
to go from 2 cm to full dilation,

1100
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,943
it takes three to four hours.

1101
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,655
{\an8}So why did it progress so quickly?
Were there risk factors for rapid labor?

1102
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,157
That's what you're curious about?

1103
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,243
Did the baby really feel slippery
as if you might drop it?

1104
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,245
I don't know.
All I did was hold my hands out.

1105
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,705
Right?

1106
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:30,124
Honestly, you can't say
she delivered the baby.

1107
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,918
It just came out.
You can't count that as her first.

1108
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,753
Of course, it does.

1109
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,798
I'm jealous. Congratulations, Yi-young.

1110
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,133
Right. See you tomorrow.

1111
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:40,676
Hey.

1112
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,512
Still, doesn't it feel better
to struggle together than alone?

1113
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:47,266
That's exactly why I didn't go solo.
I'm meant to be in a group. So--

1114
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,643
- Can this wait until tomorrow?
- Hear me out for a second.

1115
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,437
I discovered something really amazing.

1116
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,646
Check this out.

1117
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,939
There's an O in Oh Yi-young.

1118
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,399
There's a B in Kim Sa-bi.

1119
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,526
There's a G in Pyo Nam-kyung.

1120
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,444
I spell it with a K.

1121
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,321
And I'm Um Jay.

1122
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,364
There's a Y in Jay.

1123
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,410
As in OB-GYN.

1124
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:08,329
Totally mind-blowing.

1125
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,331
Isn't that incredible?

1126
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:14,752
I guess not.

1127
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:17,504
Fine.

1128
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,381
I'm so hungry.

1129
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,300
You haven't eaten, right?
Aren't you starving?

1130
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,261
Want to grab dinner before we go?

1131
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,472
- I have plans--
- I'm busy--

1132
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,515
- Next time.
- Next time.

1133
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,020
Sure. Let's eat next time.

1134
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,272
- I have plans too.
- I see.

1135
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,523
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

1136
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,484
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1137
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:40,653
Bye.

1138
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,087
My goodness.

1139
01:10:58,796 --> 01:10:59,880
She's running.

1140
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:01,632
What's gotten into her?

1141
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,804
I've never seen Yi-young run before.

1142
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,847
She woke up on her own this morning.

1143
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,599
Oh, no. I think she's late.

1144
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,351
That never bothered her before.

1145
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,686
You're right about that.

1146
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,146
They say you mature
after delivering a baby.

1147
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,774
- I guess it's true.
- You know what Do-won said?

1148
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:21,860
He wouldn't have chosen OB-GYN
if he hadn't seen a delivery as an intern.

1149
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,279
Really?

1150
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:26,115
Does that mean Yi-young
will become a doctor like him?

1151
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,158
That may be a bit difficult.

1152
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:30,828
Right?

1153
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,833
Yi-young is a really transparent kid.

1154
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,584
I can always read her face.

1155
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,713
She seems totally into OB-GYN work now.

1156
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,048
I think she'll really settle down
this time around.

1157
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,719
It's only been three days.
I don't know if she'll last forever.

1158
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,930
But I'm sure she'll have
the common decency to last for a month.

1159
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,182
Gosh. Just a month?

1160
01:11:57,187 --> 01:12:00,524
You probably didn't hear about this
since you were on vacation.

1161
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:02,609
It's a legendary story of a baby's birth.

1162
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:07,114
Our first-year resident here
delivered a baby in the hallway.

1163
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:09,867
I see. It was you.

1164
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,079
- Yes.
- Prof. Seo must've chewed you out.

1165
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:17,541
Well, first-years can make mistakes.

1166
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:22,004
Gosh, Jung-min always had a nasty temper.

1167
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:26,675
Everyone who witnesses
a delivery for the first time says,

1168
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,886
"Professor, I think OB is my calling."

1169
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:29,970
They all say that.

1170
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,724
Really?

1171
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,184
You're not interested, Dr. Oh?

1172
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,852
Not really.

1173
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,691
I guess it's still
a bit too early to know.

1174
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:46,987
I don't let just anyone do this, you know.

1175
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:51,325
But since today's surgery went well
and to celebrate your first delivery,

1176
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:52,910
why don't you do the last suture?

1177
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:54,036
That's okay, ma'am.

1178
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,247
I see. Is it because you're scared?

1179
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,166
I'll be here watching. It's okay.

1180
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:00,334
I'm okay. Really.

1181
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,807
I'll… I'll do it next time.

1182
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,350
Is she serious?

1183
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,476
It's a joke.

1184
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:18,852
She's just kidding, Doctor.

1185
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:22,272
Professor, I'll finish up.

1186
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:25,109
You can leave it to me and get some rest.

1187
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,237
Good work.

1188
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,405
Thank you.

1189
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,793
- Good work today.
- Thank you.

1190
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:44,670
Excuse me.

1191
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:45,587
Yes?

1192
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,006
What was the name
of that first-year resident?

1193
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,134
Dr. Oh Yi-young.

1194
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,890
I see. Oh Yi-young.

1195
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,144
So that's her name.

1196
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,314
Good work today.

1197
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,483
Yes, you too.

1198
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,861
{\an8}THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST, RA MI-RAN,

{\an8}RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1200

<i>The warning signs</i>
<i>have been showing for a while.</i>

1201
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,744
<i>The residents' escape and escaping.</i>

1202
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,079
<i>I may be broke, but I still have my pride.</i>

1203
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,290
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>you're cut out to be a doctor.</i>

1204
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:04,541
<i>They're all the same.</i>

1205
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:05,876
Please, just this once.

1206
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:07,920
{\an8}Look, Dr. First-Year. This isn't right.

1207
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,296
{\an8}<i>Use your head.</i>

1208
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,466
{\an8}<i>Why do patients keep complaining</i>
<i>about the dressings?</i>

1209
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:13,967
{\an8}- Well…
- What is it?

1210
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,512
{\an8}Hey! How will you manage as a doctor?

1211
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:19,181
{\an8}<i>Is this what you call</i>
<i>being "in the doghouse"?</i>

1212
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,390
{\an8}You're quitting as a doctor?

1213
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,352
{\an8}<i>Why do you do your job like such a fool?</i>

1214
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:24,269
{\an8}What did you say?

1215
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,647
{\an8}Let's not lie to each other from now on.

1216
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,566
{\an8}<i>It's just that things go wrong</i>
<i>whenever she's involved.</i>

1217
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,692
{\an8}Say it.

1218
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,446
{\an8}By the way, they're your own patients.
How do you not know them?

1219
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,198
{\an8}<i>You're an enemy, not a colleague.</i>

1220
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,825
{\an8}Yi-young, you're 50 million in debt.
Don't forget that.

1221
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,410
{\an8}How about you try something else?

1222
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,038
{\an8}I don't think I can be a doctor.

1223
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,498
{\an8}Tell her to handle it herself.

1224
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:46,375
{\an8}<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

1225
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,544
{\an8}<i>What am I doing here?</i>

1226
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:52,172
{\an8}It's the perfect weather for running away.
